**What it is**: When comparing the price of various paid tiers of Airtable, the rows highlight on hover to make it easier to compare the different levels.

**Why itâ€™s good**: This design helps to balance aesthetics and usability by providing this row highlighting. This sort of visual feature makes it easy to compare individual rows, without require a constant visual element to help establish them.

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: This is a feature you’re familiar with, when you stick a limb (or item) in between the doors of an elevator, the doors re-open.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Ostensibly, the reason that this feature exists is for safety—and I enjoy not having to worry about being maimed in the mornings. In practice, though, it’s used as a hack to hold an elevator.</p>

<p>You can get incredible information through watching how people hack systems. In this case, when users need to hold an elevator door open, sticking an arm through the doors is much easier than finding a specific button. It’s reliable and easy, but it’s also a behavior that we learn from watching others.</p>

<p>The real reason that this is interesting, though, is that what the designers made as a <em>safety feature</em> has become a <em>standard use</em>. It’s a testament to how robust the feature is: we potentially disregard our bodily integrity for convenience because we <em>know</em> it will work.</p>

<p>Robust features (especially safety features) have this effect. You can see it in things like autosave functions. When you work with a product that has a robust autosave with historical capabilities (like Google Docs), it fundamentally changes how you interact with a filesystem. Whenever we produce something that is this robust and reliable, we open up entirely new possibilities for our users.</p>

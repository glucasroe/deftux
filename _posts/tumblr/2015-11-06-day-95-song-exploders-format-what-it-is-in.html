<p><strong>What it is</strong>: In the smash hit podcast Song Exploder, host Hrishikesh Hirway rarely if ever appears on the final recording of the interview.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: There is a brilliant editorial position that is embedded in this decision. As you listen to these stories, the flow of them becomes enveloping. You step into the world of the artist’s decisions, and become part of their process. It almost feels like Hrishikesh sits down and the story comes pouring out of them.</p>

<p>It’s clear that this isn’t the case though. At times, he leaves in the audio of himself asking a question when the context is important, or when the musician reacts to his question. In this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hrishihirway/song-exploder-no-18-the#t=5:38">full 15 minute episode</a> you hear him ask one question at about 5:40. This isn’t an accident, it’s a purposeful choice in the structuring of the program.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there’s a precedent set for it, but the closest thing that I can think of is ghost writing a biography. Hrishikesh gets that he isn’t the focus, but that exact understanding is what makes the final work so powerful, and makes him so perfect for the role.</p>

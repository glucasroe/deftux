<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When Waze finds a faster route, it tells you “There’s a better route” and automatically selects it after a short period.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: The language for this is great. “There’s a better way” feels so soothing and helpful when you’re stuck in traffic. I love that it also knows to select the faster route if you don’t interact with it. By contrast, Google Maps defaults to cancelling the new option, which is perplexing—obviously I want the fastest route possible!</p>

<p>What I particularly like about this design is how Waze displays the info specifically for glancing. Each fragment of information in this modal window is reinforced in multiple ways. The timer is both a number and a circle graph. The time saved is shown in a minutes saved and a new arrival time. When you are designing for consumption while someone is driving, getting the idea quickly is paramount.</p>

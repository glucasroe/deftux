<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When listening to Spotify&rsquo;s radio, the thumbs up icon tells you that it&rsquo;s improving the station before adding it to a playlist for you.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: First, the pause is brilliant. I&rsquo;m sure Spotify doesn&rsquo;t need any processing time to pick the next song, but this brief pause makes me feel like they&rsquo;re actually doing something important. The reason that it works to make me wait for a second is that it&rsquo;s <em>unlikely at this point</em> that I would want to do something else, so the action doesn&rsquo;t block me.</p>

<p>The part that elevates this to an amazing design is automatically adding it to a playlist. Liking a song to improve a station is a concept that I&rsquo;m used to because of Pandora. Adding it to a list where I can find it later (and play it by itself) is a direct sell of Spotify&rsquo;s added value - You can listen to it on the radio, but you <em>can also listen to it by itself</em>. Even though it&rsquo;s subtle, this interface piece underscores that value proposition.</p>

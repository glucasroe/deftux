<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Kanger Nebox uses temperature instead of wattage as its user settable scale.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: A good friend of mine replaced smoking with vaping about a year ago. In the past year, I’ve watched him sell or attempt to sell a wide variety of people on the various systems that he uses. Observing the faces of his intended mentees, I often see a pretty familiar look: “This is complicated.”</p>

<p>There’s a lot to keep track of when you go from smoking to vaping. You learn a lot of new terms about electricity, like Ohms, watts, and amperage. It feels complicated, which is important when you are dealing with potentially dangerous levels of energy or batteries shorting out.</p>

<p>He showed me this box today, with the tremendous difference of listing <em>temperature</em> as its settable parameter. Most boxes require you to set <em>wattage</em>, which doesn’t necessarily have a direct relationship with temperature. Setting the temperature requires some extra safety features, if you just hold down the button it taps out and doesn’t let you set anything on fire, but it’s built in and doesn’t require you to know that up front.</p>

<p>The important aspect here is <em>using a metric new users understand</em>. Wattage isn’t something the average person deals with, so they have to learn what it means and what relationships it has towards heat and power draw. Temperature is much more accessible, and feels like something that you can be a part of, even if you are an amateur.</p>

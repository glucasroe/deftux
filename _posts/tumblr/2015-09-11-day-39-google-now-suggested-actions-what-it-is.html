<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you make reminders in Google Now, it will try to find relevant web content based off of the reminder.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I often joke that Google is constantly testing the line between helpful and creepy. In this case, I had asked it to remind me to cancel Spotify when I had arrived at home, and it found the relevant article in Spotify&rsquo;s help.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how it triggers (and really that&rsquo;s the failing in this design, it&rsquo;s amazing, how do I replicate it!?) but considering how bang on the suggestion is, I highly approve.</p>

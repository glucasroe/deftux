<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">Ommwriter</a> was one of the first of a breed of &ldquo;distraction free&rdquo; writing utilities. When you load it up, it takes over your full screen and darkens any secondary montiors.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Ommwriter&rsquo;s environment is carefully considered. It doesn&rsquo;t allow you to use multiple windows. It shuts down your secondary monitor. It plays a series of serene, instrumental songs. It has no text formatting. It gives you 3 font options.</p>

<p>It strips away distractions and forces you to focus on the work at hand. Its lack of compromise is what makes it useful, I <strong>could</strong> use so many other programs for the same concept. When the going gets tough though, nothing shuts out the clutter as well.</p>

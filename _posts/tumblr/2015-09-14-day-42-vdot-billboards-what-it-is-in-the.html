<p><strong>What it is</strong>: In the bathrooms in rest stops, VDOT puts signs above the mirrors&hellip; but in reverse!</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Clever details draw attention. This sign is utterly unremarkable, except for the fact that VDOT thought of a way to put it in my field of vision without blocking the mirrors. It only works with simplicity though, so they wisely didn&rsquo;t overdo the messaging.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you make a purchase at Starbucks with their app, it gives you the ability to tip your baristas for a few hours afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: When Starbucks first released the ability to pay with an app, I jumped at the opportunity. One less &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; card to carry and a constantly refreshing bucket of coffee dollars. Tipping is really important to me, so I had a pretty constant annoyance that I would have to carry cash in to tip the baristas. What&rsquo;s the point of a digital system if I still have to bring cash?</p>

<p>About a year ago, I gained the ability to apply a tip after a transaction happens, and the window stays open and adjustable for a few hours. The brilliance comes in a few forms, the preset amounts so it&rsquo;s literally 1 tap to select an amount, the notification that indicates that the purchase has gone through (I don&rsquo;t mind the prompt, it helps me to remember), and the transaction history that updates as you select the different amounts. The major selling point for me though is that it gives you the ability to select these amounts in the notification, which means I can give the baristas a dollar with my smartwatch.</p>

<p>Welcome to the future.</p>

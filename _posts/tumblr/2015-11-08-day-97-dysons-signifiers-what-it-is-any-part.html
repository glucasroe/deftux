<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Any part that is used to disassemble a Dyson DC50 is a bright, solid red.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Just as a note of clarity, occasionally people use <em>affordance</em> when they mean <em>signifier</em>. In this case, the affordance is mechanism that allows me to disassemble the vacuum, while the signifier is the bright red plastic.</p>

<p>The fact that this vacuum can be so thoroughly disassembled without tools is itself a feat of fantastic, user centered design. The bright red plastic mechanisms make it self evident. I bought this vacuum refurbished and it didn’t come with a manual, yet I could fully disassemble it just by looking for red pieces.</p>

<p>The red pieces also offer a way to navigate the user manual. If you look carefully, you’ll see small pops of red on the manual printout that I have the assembly resting on. In each case, the vacuum itself is rendered in monochrome <em>except for the piece that you need which is bright red</em>. There’s no ambiguity about what you should use and when.</p>

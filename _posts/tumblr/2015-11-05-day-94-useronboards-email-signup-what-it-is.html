<p><strong>What it is</strong>: UserOnboard gives you a modal window to sign up for their mailing list at the end of a slideshow.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: I spend more time than I’m really proud of shouting about modal windows. If you’d like to provoke a lot of colorful language and my immediate departure, just throw a modal in my face in the middle of what I’m doing.</p>

<p>This, friends, is how you ask people to sign up for your mailing list without being an ass. First, and most importantly, <em>the modal appears upon user action</em>. This is <em>not</em> something that comes up in the middle of my task, I literally have to click on something to trigger the window. Second, the modal appears <em>after I have consumed the value from the site</em>. Samuel could have put this in the middle of the slideshow, but he didn’t because that’s insane and narcissistic behavior. Third, the modal window tells me <em>exactly what I can expect to happen</em>, and indicates how and why my email will be used with clear value propositions and purpose.</p>

<p>If you are resorting to slapping your user in the face with an unexpected sign up form, <em>you are wrong</em>. I can’t think of a simpler way to put it without expletives or name calling. Don’t do it.</p>

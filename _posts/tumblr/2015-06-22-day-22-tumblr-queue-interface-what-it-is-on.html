<p><strong>What it is</strong>: On the Queue page for Tumblr, it lists out the date and time that each post is scheduled for.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: For a project like this that aims at a single post a day, scheduling posts is a grand idea. The queue is an even better idea however, a list of posts that are automatically published every day at the same time.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m about to head off on a weekend trip, so I&rsquo;ve been queuing up posts to hit for the days that I&rsquo;m gone. How much do I have in the pipeline? Enough to get through the weekend?</p>

<p>These little tooltips next to each post answer my question immediately. Instead of having to count on my fingers or look at a calendar, I immediatelly know how much buffer I have built up and how long it will last. Perfect!</p>

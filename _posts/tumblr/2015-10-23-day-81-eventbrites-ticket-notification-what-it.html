<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you have an event coming up, Eventbrite sends you a notification. The notification has a QR code in it that serves as your ticket.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: When attending an event, you have a lot going on. Frequently, you are going to a place that you aren’t familiar with, and that brings a lot of complexity. Considering the complexity is usually managed via your phone (with Maps, Calendars, and messaging apps), being required to keep a ticket up on your phone is a liability.</p>

<p>This notification popped up just before the event, and as you can see, they actually <em>put the barcode for my ticket in the notification</em>. This inclusion means that if I was in the midst of navigating or communicating with others, I still have the ticket right there to quickly check in when I find the place.</p>

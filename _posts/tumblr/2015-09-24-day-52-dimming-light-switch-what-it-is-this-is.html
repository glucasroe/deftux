<p><strong>What it is</strong>: This is a light dimmer that looks just like a normal light switch. Seems pretty mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: This interface is so fantastic because it uses a familiar form factor and just adds in a new element. Let&rsquo;s pretend you don&rsquo;t know what a light dimmer is and you&rsquo;re afraid to experiment. You <em>still have the ability to use this like a normal light switch</em>.</p>

<p>Often when we are developing new interfaces, we want to make something completely bespoke and custom. However, it&rsquo;s so much better to reference the things that our users already know and understand. We don&rsquo;t have to be limited by what already exists, but <em>extending</em> the uses of existing interfaces (instead of doing a complete redesign) helps meet users where they are, whether they are experts or beginners.</p>

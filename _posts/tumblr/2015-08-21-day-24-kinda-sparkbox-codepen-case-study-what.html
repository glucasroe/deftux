<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://codepen.seesparkbox.com/">A remarkably in depth, nuanced (formerly) real time case study</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Really? Do you need an explanation of this? Let me finish hyperventilating and I&rsquo;ll try.</p>

<p>First: Why do case studies exist? To get you work, right? This case study transcends that idea entirely. This will probably get Sparkbox work, but it is a tremendous gift to the design community. I&rsquo;ve watched the process play out as they release new content, delighted by the nuance and watching them discuss about the places where the process works and where it doesn&rsquo;t. The case study is specific to CodePen, and broad in thinking about how we design modern products. It is a real time, multimedia thesis.</p>

<p>Second: I guarantee that if you are a designer, you looked up Sparkbox and considered a move to the midwest after looking at this case study. It gives you such a powerful sense of who they are as a company, how they work, and what motivates them.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what else to say. Just&hellip; Go read it.</p>

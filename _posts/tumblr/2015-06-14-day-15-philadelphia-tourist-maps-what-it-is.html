<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When walking around Philadelphia, there are a number of signs to help orient tourists like me. These signs change based on which direction you&rsquo;re walking on the street.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: One of the best things about good UX (and in my opinion, one of the things that makes it hardest to talk about) is that the truly best pieces of it are so obvious that they don&rsquo;t seem worth talking about. When I pointed out these signs to my wife (and pointedly took photos of it,) her comment was &ldquo;Well of course, how else would you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reasons that these signs make so much sense is that they understand their integration with the environment. Not only do they orient you based on the direction you&rsquo;re walking, they also highlight things that are close and along the route you are walking. Some smaller signs mounted high on lamps take this a step further, recentering the map on you and only showing you the things in front of you.</p>

<p>In all, it&rsquo;s a tremendously simple effect that has great utility.</p>

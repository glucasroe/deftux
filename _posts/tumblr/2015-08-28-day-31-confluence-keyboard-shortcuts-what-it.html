<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When working in Confluence, there are a number of shortcuts available to you at any given time. Confluence indicates these shortcuts with subtle hints, like underlining a single letter or including it in parenthesis in a tooltip.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Keyboard shortcuts are the consummate expert&rsquo;s tool. For any application, there&rsquo;s inevitably a cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts somewhere that indicates everything you can do with them. I even have an index card on my desk with a list of shortcuts for Trello while I&rsquo;m learning them.</p>

<p>Confluence isn&rsquo;t a tool that most people live in, so expecting the user to memorize all of keyboard shortcuts isn&rsquo;t realistic. This subtle indication doesn&rsquo;t get in the way, but it does tell me what things I can do quickly. Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve learned the keyboard shortcuts incredibly quickly because they&rsquo;re always present.</p>

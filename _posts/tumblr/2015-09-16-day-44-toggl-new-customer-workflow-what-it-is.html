<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you are picking projects, Toggl also gives you a way to add new clients and projects as part of the workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Nobody likes being told &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re in the wrong part of the app.&rdquo; This flow is particularly effective because it accomodates a user&rsquo;s thought process - instead of giving an empty state &ldquo;nothing matched your search&rdquo; it takes the data of your search and uses it constructively. It turns a &ldquo;no&rdquo; into a &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; so I don&rsquo;t have to jump over into the projects section to enter in the new thing I&rsquo;m working on.</p>

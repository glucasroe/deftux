<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Trello strips away all of their homepage content to a single pair of CTAs. When you&rsquo;re logged in, it gives you the message &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re logged in! Go to your boards.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Designing websites that allow logins are a fundamentally different task than more static sites. Every time you make a content decision, you have to ask &ldquo;Is this right for both audiences?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so clever about this is subtle. You&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s a difference between the URLs because Trello.com automatically redirects you to your boards when you&rsquo;re logged in. They know that you still might find your way to this homepage somehow, so they give you a simple and friendly way to get back. Thanks guys.</p>

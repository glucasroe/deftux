<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When recording a video with the standard camera in Android Lollipop, holding the phone in portrait mode gives a small icon that prompts you to rotate the phone.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I&rsquo;m not the type of person to describe vertical video as a disease of our time, but I&rsquo;m not exactly the biggest fan of it. In this case, this little reminder seems like a great solution. It doesn&rsquo;t get in the way, it doesn&rsquo;t prevent you from recording, and it disappears as soon as you begin recording.</p>

<p>The small reminder is subtle and useful, so hopefully your video isn&rsquo;t ruthlessly letterboxed on Youtube. Slick.</p>

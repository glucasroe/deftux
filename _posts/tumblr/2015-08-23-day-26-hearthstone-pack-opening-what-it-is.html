<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Most of the cards you get in Hearthstone come in these packs of 5. You can purchase them directly, or get them as rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Whenever you are creating a system based off of microtransactions, there&rsquo;s always the question of &ldquo;What is the user buying?&rdquo; Whenever I&rsquo;ve played a game that requires me to pay just to play it, I respond colorfully and delete it. (I&rsquo;m looking at you Clash of Clans)</p>

<p>Hearthstone is a card game, so how do you make a <em>digital</em> card that has worth? By wrapping the card acquisition in a little fanfare, Hearthstone adds a level of anticipation and reverence to each pack. Not only that, the pack bursting apart and each card flipping as you click it reinforces Hearthstone&rsquo;s physical interface.</p>

<p>The blue aura that you see around the last card I open indicates it&rsquo;s of higher rarity, and the game&rsquo;s narrator (The Innkeeper) exclaims &ldquo;Rare!&rdquo; when I reveal it. It does this with any card that isn&rsquo;t a common card, so it is guaranteed once a pack. The anticipation is small, but as an avid player of the game, my heart rate skyrockets when I hover on a card with an orange glow. (Which is the rarest type, legendary) It&rsquo;s one of those hooks that doesn&rsquo;t lose its magic when you see behind the curtain.</p>

<p>If you want more information on Hearthstone&rsquo;s physical interface (Inculuding the pack opening), I highly recommend this amazing <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022036/Hearthstone-How-to-Create-an">presentation by one of its designers, Derek Sakamoto</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When inside of a Treehouse Module, a small navigation shows you the content for the entire module.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Treehouse is designed to keep you just outside of your comfort zone, so they do a lot to help ease the pain. There are small rewards, good ways of indicating your progress, and constant contextualization.</p>

<p>This little navigation appears inside of a module, a collection of lessons, code challenges, and quizzes that are like a course. The navigation has a ton of information packed into a tiny space with titles, content types, and location all wrapped together. I particularly like the use of the profile picture as the location marker - it&rsquo;s instantly recognizable and helps reinforce that I&rsquo;m making progress (Even in PHP)</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: YNAB is relaunching their newsletter. This is the email they sent me to tell me about it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The language used through this entire piece is so carefully crafted. It&rsquo;s conversational and fun. It&rsquo;s interesting, and drives you towards the goal, signing up for the new newsletter.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s my belief that there&rsquo;s a special circle in hell for people who grab my email from another list and start spamming me, so I especially appreciate the secondary sign up.</p>

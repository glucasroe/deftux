<p><strong>What it is</strong>: In the  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.jamesgay.fitnotes&amp;hl=en">Fitnotes tracking app</a>, saving a set starts a configurable timer.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Frequently, really useful features are quite simple. Timing a break on saving a set is a pretty simple idea.</p>

<p>What makes this good is the flexibility and customization available. The time is easily changed, as are the notification settings. It verifies in triplicate that a timer has started. (The clock starts, the green banner slides down, and a notification appears) It also isn’t demanding about how you use the timer, but instead feeds the action into an existing feature.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: YNAB is a budgeting app (Short for You Need a Budget (You probably do)). It is a powerful example of a UI being shaped by underlying philosophy. Back to the point - When you are entering income, if you indicate something is income and then enter the dollars in as an outflow, it stops you with a modal window.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Modal windows are awful. This is especially true in an interface like this, where I&rsquo;m using all keyboard entry and have to find my mouse.</p>

<p>This modal is necessary though, and it is a gold standard for best practices. It appears at a reasonable time, after I&rsquo;ve finished typing and hit enter or clicked save. It has very short, scannable copy that includes bold text to help me figure out the issue. It uses semantically accurate copy on the buttons, indicating what each does. It even has a somewhat self deprecating header &ldquo;Hey user, I&rsquo;m being rude, just let me check this really quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is rude, but it&rsquo;s saved me more than one headache as I speed through entering transactions and so I&rsquo;m grateful for it.</p>

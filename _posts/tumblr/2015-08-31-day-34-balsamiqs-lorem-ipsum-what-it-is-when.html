<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When entering a paragraph in Balsamiq, typing &ldquo;lorem&rdquo; inserts a full paragraph of filler text.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Balsamiq doesn&rsquo;t do a ton, so it makes what it does do work very efficiently. Contextual suggestions don&rsquo;t have to be brilliant as long as they support the workflow.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/">Affinity Photo</a> is a photo editing app from Serif. When you select tools, a small tooltip at the bottom tells you how to use it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Photo editing is pretty obviously not a new space. Anytime new software is introduce, its immediately compared to Photoshop and sometimes Pixelmator. I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy recalling the gruelling climb to become proficient in Photoshop. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it again.</p>

<p>The reason that these directions are so brilliant is because of their economy. They tell you how different click patterns will behave. They tell you how modifier keys will change the behavior. The microcopy is explanatory, but short.</p>

<p><b>What it is</b>: Timehop recently released a photo backup feature. This screen is how they sold it to me.</p><p><b>Why it&rsquo;s good</b>: Good copy isn’t easy to write and Timehop manages to pack a lot into a small space. They do a great job at speaking in their own, unique voice while also making it very clear what they’re offering.


My favorite though is the action labels at the bottom. This is how you do cute labels folks. They’re silly, they resell the product, and yet they are <b>accurate</b> and <b>clear</b>. (the decline label also isn’t insulting, which should be a given but somehow isn’t)</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Kickstarter newsletter sign up in the footer of their site. Clicking the scissors three times causes the footer to fall off and the sign up form to appear in its place.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I have a special dislike for mailing list signups, largely because so many sites seem to bludgeon me over the head with them. Kickstarter&rsquo;s newsletter signup sets a completely different tone for what they&rsquo;re accomplishing, you aren&rsquo;t just opting to recieve emails, you&rsquo;re <em>joining the club</em>.</p>

<p>This is a true example of delightful design; The designers didn&rsquo;t just craft a goofy animation, it&rsquo;s a genuinely suprising effect. It is a perfect support to Kickstarter&rsquo;s playful, small company image, quite a feat considering their size and revenue.</p>

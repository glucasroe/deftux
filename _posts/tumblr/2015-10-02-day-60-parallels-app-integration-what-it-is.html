<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> is a Windows virtualization application for Macs. (It lets you run a Windows machine on your Mac, inception style.) The applications that Parallels virtualizes run on your dock alongside your regular applications.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Your users don’t care a single iota about your data model. Let me rephrase that, <em>unless they’re required</em> to interact with your data model, the users <em>shouldn’t have to care about it</em>.</p>

<p>Someone at Parallels asked the question “What is it you’re trying to do?” The answer is usually “I want to run a Windows application on my Mac.” Parallels is helping you bridge that gap by removing the first step—launching the virtualized machine. Your average user doesn’t want to think about the prerequisites for getting to their task. They don’t want to have to process: “I need to launch this other program before I can launch the program I want inside of it.”</p>

<p>Breaking down the technological barriers and allowing the user’s tasks to surface is an essential goal of UX design. Parallels removes the most confusing step from a complex task so the user only needs to think about their goal.</p>

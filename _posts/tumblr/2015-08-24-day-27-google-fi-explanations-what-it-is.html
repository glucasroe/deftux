<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Google Fi is Google&rsquo;s phone carrier. It&rsquo;s a combination of leased traffic from Sprint and T-Mobile, and a lot of verified Wi Fi networks. The explainations on their website use simple language and animations to help convey the fairly complex techologies that make it work.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: This is a master class in explaining complex, technological concepts to inexperienced users. How do you go about explaining wifi switching? Multi network use? VPN tunneling? This site brushes all of these concepts, and explains them in a way that either lays out the concept clearly, or explains it generally to the point that the user needs to understand.</p>

<p>Take for instance the section on data encryption. They know that most people have heard to be careful of sending data over unencrypted networks, so is auto wifi connecting safe? Here&rsquo;s how they explain it: &ldquo;<em>Your data is secured through encryption when we connect you to open Wi-Fi hotspots. It&rsquo;s like your data has a private tunnel to drive through.</em>&rdquo; Two sentences, a lot left unsaid, but enough that I understand why it&rsquo;s not a concern.</p>

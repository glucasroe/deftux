<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/index.html">CodeKit</a> is a utility application for preprocessing files and for a host of other supports for modern web development. When adding a project to CodeKit, you can drag and drop the folder onto the window. Dragging a folder onto the window highlights two areas: one to add as a project and the other to add as a framework.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: CodeKit is a Mac App. Macs are particularly suited to dragging and dropping; it’s part of the visual language of the system and is well-established in the user base.</p>

<p>I like this particular solution because of how clearly it shows state and suggests action. First, the top <em>drop</em> area is much larger than it appears. It extends to the title bar and the entire top section of the window. Its increased size and layout emphasize that this is the suggested action—most of the time, you’re adding projects, not frameworks.</p>

<p>CodeKit meets expectations by darkening the section you’re dropping into, but it also takes an extra step in being verbose about it. It highlights the name of the folder that you’re dragging, so in plain language you can see the outcome of your action.</p>

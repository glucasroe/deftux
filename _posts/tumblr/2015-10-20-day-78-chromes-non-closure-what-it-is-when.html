<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you tap command + q in Chrome, it doesn’t instantly close the app. Instead, it displays a banner which says “Hold ⌘Q to quit.”</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As a enthusiastic browser tab user, I am consistently hitting command + w to close tabs. Small challenge: next to the “w” on a keyboard is the “q,” and the system default for OSX is to quit the entire application when command + q is pressed. This usually means attempting to recover the ~30 or so sites that I have open at any given time. It was a consistent issue before Chrome introduced this feature.</p>

<p>This approach works because of its internal logic (i.e. you usually hit the wrong key when you’re in a hurry, so we can assume you won’t be holding it down) and the consistent message. Instead of just preventing the action, the system tells you <em>why</em> nothing happened when you pressed your key combination.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When browsing listings on Yelp, there&rsquo;s a small map that gives you the location of your different establishments. You can expand the map with a link titled &ldquo;Mo&rsquo; Map&rdquo; that pops the map open.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The importance of a map can&rsquo;t be overstated when looking for something close (in my case, to a hotel). The way that Yelp has handled this walks a delightfully fine line. The playful language makes it feel inconsequential, you aren&rsquo;t changing your query, just modifying it.</p>

<p>My favorite piece though can be easy to miss, the listings also strip down their complexity when the map is larger. This is done very intentionally to keep the listings approximately the same height, which keeps you at about the same place in the listings if you&rsquo;ve been browsing them.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Sunrise is a calendar app that acts as an intermediary between all of your other calendars. I started using it because it would pull my due dates from Trello, but I&rsquo;ve also found that it integrates with just about every calendar service.</p>

<p>This is how you create an event in Sunrise, and some of the options available to you.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Two wordsâ€”consolidation and suggestion. First, every conceivable option that you can apply to this event is rolled into one densely packed interface. It is dense, but the flow makes complete sense because it feels like a list of questions, and that list matches how I think about my events:</p>

<ul><li><em>What am I doing?</em></li>
<li><em>When?</em></li>
<li><em>Where?</em></li>
<li><em>Who?</em></li>
<li><em>Anything Else?</em></li>
</ul><p>It rolls in smart suggestions, like having an incredibly fast and accurate calendar lookup, pulling in my address book for invitations, and even subtle things like changing the icon based on what the event is called.</p>

<p>My favorite piece of it though is that <em>Sunrise allows you to create an event without asking you which calendar it&rsquo;s on</em>. This is incredibly important to an aggregation tool like this - I don&rsquo;t want to think about <em>how</em> I have to create the event, I just want to create it. While the interface could be better, making the calendar the last choice before you save instead of the first choice (Like Outlook for instance) removes so much mental friction from the process, and allows me to focus on the more relevant details.</p>

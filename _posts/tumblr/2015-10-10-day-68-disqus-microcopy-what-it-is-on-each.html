<p><strong>What it is</strong>: On each section of their settings page, Disqus provides microcopy that conveys the context for each section in a single sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Microcopy serves as a bridge between me and a function. In each case here, it’s reasonably clear <em>what</em> each button does. The headlines give me an idea of what I can do in each section, which is important for scanning and general comprehension of the page.</p>

<p>What this microcopy does is more subtle: it gives me a <em>why</em> for each section. This can be impossibly difficult to do in a short headline. You need clarity and brevity so that the user can scan the page and find what they’re looking for. Consider the copy in the “Connected Accounts” section: “Connect your social media accounts for one-click login and to show off your online presence on your Disqus profile.” I now know what I will find in that section, and why it makes sense to enable the features.</p>

<p>Microcopy can’t make a bad interface good. When well-applied, though, it helps your user form a deeper understanding of your interface and your intentions.</p>

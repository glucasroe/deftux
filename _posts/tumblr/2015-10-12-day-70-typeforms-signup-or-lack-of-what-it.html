<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Typeform lets you create a form (or even multiple forms) before you ever sign up for an account.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: When your user lands on your site, it’s pretty rare that their first thought is “Oh man, hope I have to fill out a sign in form!” They have goals to accomplish, but we usually throw a sign up form in their face as the first thing. We hope that they’ve gleaned enough value from our marketing material to take that first step big step of signing up.</p>

<p>As our technology has progressed, this imperative <em>need</em> to sign up for everything is evaporating, and yet you still see it on almost every site. Not only does Typeform allow you to just start making a form, (with some minor interruptions, grumble grumble) it even <em>saves the form in a local session</em> so if you leave and come back, your work is still there. They message this with a small button with a subtle flash in the top right, saying “Save Account.”</p>

<p>Duolingo has recently taken this approach too, and it is so wonderful because it allows <em>demonstrated value</em>. I don’t have to fork over my credentials to see if this product will be useful. I can jump in and try it out and then sign up when I see the value.</p>

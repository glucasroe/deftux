<p><strong>What it is</strong>: The Starbucks near my work has signs in the window that discourages bringing in pets, but does so using positive language.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Starbucks uses tone very skillfully. Instead of leading with saying &ldquo;HEY MAN YOU CAN&rsquo;T DO THIS&rdquo; they instead lead with &ldquo;We welcome <strong>service animals</strong>.&rdquo; In case that wasn&rsquo;t clear enough for you, they underscore it with &ldquo;No pets, please. Thanks.&rdquo; - the casual sort of language that a friend might use when asking you not to bring your dog inside of their house.</p>

<p>Instead of directing your attention to what they don&rsquo;t allow, making them appear like a scold or a buzzkill, Starbucks instead flips it to a positive. We don&rsquo;t just <em>allow</em> your service animal, we <em>welcome</em> him or her! Bring &lsquo;em on in!</p>

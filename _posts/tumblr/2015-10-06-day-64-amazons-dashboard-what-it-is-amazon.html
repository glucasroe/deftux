<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Amazon recently released a dashboard that pops up on your account page with a bunch of high-level data.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As a retailer, Amazon’s diversity is one of its main selling points. As they begin subsuming more lines of business, they have created a problem for themselves on the account page. How can a single page encompass the enormity of your relationship with the company?</p>

<p>This dashboard highlights a step in the right direction. The majority of the information on it is directly relevant to me, and is stuff that I would frequently be looking for. The true success, though, is in the wonderful links under each snippet of data that tell me exactly how to interact with it. I’m most impressed with the “Subscribe and Save” where it indicates that an order is coming while selling it as savings, and yet still telling you when it will trigger. It breaks down a little bit in some areas, like the audiobook sell, but the intra-product advertising doesn’t feel heavy-handed here. It’s really that balance of information and action that makes it so successful.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Guides in Sketch have a constantly visible tooltip that tell you the exact pixel value it is placed on.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Visual design and our desire to make designs “Clean” can lead to a whole host of usability problems. I remember one designer in days of yore that I argued with repeatedly because they didn’t care for breadcrumb navigation. All of the research that I found supported out how useful and helpful breadcrumbs are, so we never quite saw eye to eye.</p>

<p>Sketch sacrifices some visual purity for the benefit of being declarative and obvious. Pixel values that I’m adding guides to are usually important, so having the values visible instead of requiring me to guess is a safe bet.</p>

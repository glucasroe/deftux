<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://www.helloclue.com/index.html">Clue is an app for tracking your menstrual cycle</a>. It visualizes the cycle with a circle, and places ranges and data points on it that are positioned relative to different parts of the cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: When I received the glowing email that recommended this product, the main point was the application’s very simple visualization of time. I particularly enjoyed the way that Clue’s creators balanced ranges of time (colored bars around the border) with specific data points (small squares on the inside of the chart).</p>

<p>In the ensuing discussion about the visualization and what made it good, this minorly edited quote summed it up nicely: “Clue allows you an easy way to enter all the data, even providing you with suggestions of things that are related but you may not have thought to track otherwise (i.e. mood).  Then, they give all that data back to you in a way that makes you feel more informed about your period&hellip; Not only does it allow you to prepare for what&rsquo;s coming, but also it removes some of the fear caused by experiencing weird symptoms&hellip;  by showing you what&rsquo;s ‘normal’ for you.”</p>

<p>The combination of visualization and smart suggestion take something that is inherently hard to predict, and makes it <em>feel</em> more manageable, even when it isn’t.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When entering a password on Amazon’s mobile app, it is defaulted to show the password in plain text below the obscured password.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As an industry, we’ve pretty much settled that passwords are pretty terrible for usability, ease of use, and general experience. When we move the password field to a mobile screen, with its constraints on space and lack of tactile feedback, all of these problems are amplified.</p>

<p>These “View Password” toggles feel like a good solution, and they’re popping up with increasing regularity. This particular version of it is my favorite because it <em>shows the plain text password underneath the obscured version</em>. For users who are used to having their password obscured as they type, a plain text field gives them the wrong signal - it doesn’t look correct. Is it secure? Are they even on the password field right now?</p>

<p>This clarifies the relationship between the password and the plain text, and is a safer default, because it has the visual signifier that we’re used to.</p>

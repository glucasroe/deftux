<p><strong>What it is</strong>: In a recent update of their user terms, Tumblr gives you a range of plain language options when you select “No”</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: There are few times that I feel more helpless as a user than when I’m looking at a EULA. I took a screenshot of the one that Apple popped up on my iPad recently, because it was <strong>56 pages</strong> I would have had to read. Not happening.</p>

<p>Most desktop software handles this rather petulantly by requiring you to agree before using the software, and quitting without warning if you decline. Facebook and Spotify recently had to deal with massive public outcry when they changed their service terms without overt notice. They expected that users read them (as if anyone has) and went ahead as if everyone tacitly agreed by using the service. Not a great way to earn user trust.</p>

<p>Tumblr’s way of getting that agreement feels far less draconian. It still sucks that I have to read 3 tab panes of endlessly scrolling content in a modal window(<em>Hint</em>: They don’t expect me to) but the casual lead in copy makes it feel less scary.</p>

<p>The best part is what happens when you decline. Instead of yelling at you and throwing the modal window back in your face, they actually give you options that consider what you would want <em>if you actually decline</em>. They give you options to end your relationship with them! They give you options to reach out for clarification! They clarify that you <em>actually need to accept if you are going to use the service</em>—but in human and gentle tone!</p>

<p>Unless you are designing for lawyers, (and honestly, even when you’re designing for lawyers) <em>don’t speak to your users like they’re lawyers</em>. Tumblr seems to get that.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you open Instagram with recent photos in your library, a small window slides up that suggests you post photos that you’ve taken that day.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: For contextual suggestion, this is obviously solid. If the user has recently taken a photo, it stands to reason that they might be coming to Instagram to post it.</p>

<p>What makes this suggestion particularly good is in its flexibility. There are more apps for photo taking and editing than I can possible think of. There are more avenues to share photos than are reasonable. Allowing users multiple ways to arrive at the desired behavior (and in a case like this, <em>prompting</em> the desired behavior) makes the application feel flexible and robust.</p>

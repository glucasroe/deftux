<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Neutrogena Naturals Face wash switches up how it handles the ingredients list, showing where the different elements come from.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The average consumer has an odd relationship with the word &ldquo;chemical.&rdquo; We use the term as a stand in for a whole host of other bad terms; toxin, carcinogen, caustic, solvent, cleaner, the list goes on. Chemical names are just as scary, we don&rsquo;t understand them so we assume it&rsquo;s bad.</p>

<p>With the natural push in many products, manufacturers have an added difficulty of conveying <em>what the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; element of their product is</em>. If I&rsquo;m uninformed as a consumer, do I have any idea what &ldquo;Cocamidopropyl Betaine&rdquo; means? Definitely not, that sounds scary.</p>

<p>By listing where the ingredients come from, Neutrogena gives credibility to its claim. Instead of just seeing a lot of words that I don&rsquo;t understand, I can see that it comes from a coconut. It&rsquo;s a move that facilitates confidence, and helps me feel like they aren&rsquo;t making baseless claims.</p>

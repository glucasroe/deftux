<p><strong>What is is</strong>: Pocket is an app that helps you keep track of things you want to read. On iOS, when you open the app while you have a URL on your clipboard, Pocket asks if you would like to save it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: One of the more frustrating behaviors on iOS is the limited way that apps are allowed to talk to each other. If your data cannot be pushed through the native share functionality, there&rsquo;s no way to get information between apps, right?</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so lovely about this small, unobtrusive interaction is that Pocket realizes that you cannot always share a url that you want to save, sometimes it comes up in a weird place that doesn&rsquo;t allow you that flexibility. This little interaction doesn&rsquo;t get in your way, but it does realize that if you have a URL that you&rsquo;ve copied, you probably want to do something with it.</p>

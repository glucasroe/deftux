<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When selecting to hook up Jetpack to a hosted Wordpress installation, it gives a highly prioritized value sell. Three bullet points. Three!</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Jetpack offers <em>36 separate services</em> inside of it&rsquo;s umbrella. 36! That&rsquo;s an incredible amount! They are selling <strong>3</strong> of them.</p>

<p>Trading off and cutting down is always brutal, and the Jetpack team did their job fantastically. They cut down 36 separate items to the 6 most important. Then they hid half of those to give it the most punch. The ones that they kept, they prioritized the action verbs in each. Brilliant salesmanship (and it worked!)</p>

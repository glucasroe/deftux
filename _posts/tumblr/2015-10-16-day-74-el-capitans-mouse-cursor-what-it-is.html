<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you wiggle your mouse quickly in OSX’s most recent update, the mouse pointer briefly becomes larger.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Besides being incredibly helpful when you’re in a multiscreen environment, (<em>Especially</em> when you are hooked up to a projector) the reason that this particular design is so effective is that it <em>mimics the current user behavior</em>. When you can’t find your mouse pointer, you shake it around because eyes are better adapted to noticing motion.</p>

<p>The decision here works because the user didn’t have to learn and remember a new behavior. Instead, the designers at Apple paid attention to the current behavior and took another step towards bridging the gap between the software and the user.</p>

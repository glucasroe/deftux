<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When translating Japanese text, Google Translate has you take a picture of it and then highlight the text with a finger.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I have always communicated with a roman alphabet. I have no idea how to get a Japanese keyboard, or how to use it once I had it. How then do I enter in my Japanese characters for translation?</p>

<p>Enter Google Translate. I have literally no idea how I would have bridged this gap without this functionality. I don&rsquo;t exactly know what purpose the highlighting holds, but as soon as you start working with it, it&rsquo;s incredibly clear.</p>

<p>Side Note on Translation Quality: Yes, it&rsquo;s not great. I used it to translate the instructions for a Japanese Water Stone I bought off of Amazon, and while broken and bizarre, I understood it well enough to have a santoku knife that I can now shave with. Brilliant!</p>

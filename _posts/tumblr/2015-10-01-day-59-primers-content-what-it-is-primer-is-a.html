<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.primer&amp;hl=en">Primer</a> is a series of bite sized marketing lessons developed by Google. The content is presented as a stack of cards that are flipped through.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: We have a tendency to design for mobile as if it’s a laptop with an oddly-sized screen. It may just be symptomatic of how <em>new</em> mobile tech is, but it doesn’t fit how users approach their devices. We use mobile phones in short bursts, in busy environments, in the times between events. Designing for linear consumption just doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>Primer clearly designs their content for mobile consumption. Content is broken up into tiny chunks, like notecards for a speech that you can flip through. Each card has a pin on it, letting you pull out important nuggets to remember later. Pinned cards appear in their own section of the app, letting you see highlights from across multiple lessons. The lessons themselves are only a few minutes long, and each includes a progress bar, a few quizzes, and a few sections of cards.</p>

<p>As we begin adopting new mediums, which come with new methods of interaction and new abilities, it&rsquo;s lazy to assume we can keep creating and using content in the same way. Primer&rsquo;s content is written to be consumed in short bursts, and its design complements that. This exemplifies how we should think about the context in which users will interact with content on specific devices.</p>

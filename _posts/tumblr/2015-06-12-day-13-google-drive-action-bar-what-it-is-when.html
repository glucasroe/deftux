<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When selecting items in Google Drive, a small toolbar pops up that allows you to star the item, pin it (Which saves it to the device,) share it, or a host of other functions that can be popped up from the side menu.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Google Drive takes a big risk in the layout of its various files. Because it uses a tile based approach, many of the features that users have come to expect aren&rsquo;t as readily available in options on the tiles themselves.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to wedge a bunch of icons on the tile itself or taking you to a different screen (Where you wouldn&rsquo;t have any mass editing options,) this toolbar accurately balances multiple use cases. While it is unfortunate that these icons don&rsquo;t tell you what they do, the compromise of granular single file activities and mass editing is brilliant.</p>

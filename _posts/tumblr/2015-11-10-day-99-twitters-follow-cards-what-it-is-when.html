<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you mouse over a username on Twitter, it pops up a small card that gives you information on their profile and allows you to follow them.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Tooltips are such a fantastic way to dig deeper without breaking context. In this case, Twitter provides me with just enough information that I get a good understanding of who I’m moused over. There are a handful of links scattered through this tooltip that navigate me to different parts of the profile (many of which are colored the “link color” that is active on the given page.) The follow button’s different treatment indicates the different action, and the immediate state change gives me a great way to find more content and relevant users on Twitter.</p>

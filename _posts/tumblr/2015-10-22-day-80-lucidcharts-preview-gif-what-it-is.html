<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When someone sends you a template from Lucidchart, it adds in a small gif that shows you all of the screens available in the template.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: This particular decision is so smart because it answers a very human question: “What is this?” In this particular case, the coworker who sent this to me hadn’t told me they were sending me something.</p>

<p>Instead of requiring some  leap of faith, Lucidchart gave me a smart preview that let me know what I would find when I opened the template. Also, I’m not entirely sure how they worked this out, but the image that showed the screens wasn’t blocked by Outlook initially, so I saw the preview even in my inbox’s default state.</p>

<p>Predicting the questions that people ask isn’t easy, but it adds so much value to a product. “What is this?” is especially important when dealing with notification emails, or other messages that weren’t initiated by user action.</p>

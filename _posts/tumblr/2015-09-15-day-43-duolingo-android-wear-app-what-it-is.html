<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>&rsquo;s Android Wear App gives you a series of 10 flashcards to practice the language you are learning.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t dealt with a lot of good android wear apps yet. Media players and Hangouts aside, most of the functionality has been bizzare and useless.</p>

<p>This app is good because it doesn&rsquo;t try too hard. It&rsquo;s very simple functionally and it doesn&rsquo;t try to force me into any awkward interfaces. (everything is a non local tap or a big swipe) Above all, the value of it makes total sense to me. Have 30 seconds? Review some flash cards!</p>

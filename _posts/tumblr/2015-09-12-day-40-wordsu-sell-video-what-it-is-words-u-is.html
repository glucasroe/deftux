<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://www.wordsu.com/">Words U</a> is an auto thesaurus for your phone. On their site, they have a short sell video, the beginning of which is a title slide that says the length of it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: This sort of tiny detail is so helpful in our cross device and attention starved world. Vimeo&rsquo;s time badge is easy to miss, especially on mobile. WordsU calling it out on the title slide ensures that I&rsquo;ll know it isn&rsquo;t a 5 minute tutorial, so I can punch in and out quickly.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Every so often, this HP printer (a Color Laserjet 4700) prints out a page with instructions that is used to clean the rollers.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: The printer spat out this page without any prompting after a particularly large print run that I did.</p>

<p>This decision is so smart to me because it <em>gave me the tool that I needed at exactly the time I needed it</em>. Instead of blocking future action with an alert and requiring me to clean the printer before moving forward, it simply gave me this page with a few concise directions. It didn’t railroad my task or require me to go get a special cleaning sheet from somewhere else. Instead, the designers and engineers used the limited elements available to accomplish the task.</p>

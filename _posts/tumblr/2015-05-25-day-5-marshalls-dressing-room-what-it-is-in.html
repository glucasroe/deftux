<p><strong>What it is</strong>: In the dressing room at Marshalls (A discount clothing retailer) the hooks on the walls for hangers are labeled with small signs reading &ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Trying on clothes is not an incredibly fun experience, so anything that makes me more comfortable is welcome.  In one corner, &ldquo;Definitely&rdquo; and &ldquo;Possibly&rdquo; are right next to each other, allowing for quick comparisons. &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; while not being incredibly well labelled, is across the room, giving some separation. With a few simple signs (and some great natural feeling light), Marshalls subtlety directs the entire experience.</p>

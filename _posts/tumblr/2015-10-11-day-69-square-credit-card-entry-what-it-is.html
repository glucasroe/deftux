<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Square’s CashTag service has a very simple and condensed credit card form that wraps everything into a linear process while keeping you on a single screen.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: It’s worth noting that Square isn’t the only company that’s adopted this type of interface. I noticed a similar credit card entry when I was setting up Lyft.</p>

<p>This credit card entry does a lot to keep you contextualized in the form and to indicate where you are in the process. It auto selects the type of card when you enter the first few digits (Note: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/72768/how-do-you-detect-credit-card-type-based-on-number">You should do this too</a>) It keeps the last 4 of the card available, which is typically used as an identifier. There are even small hints, like flipping the card image over when it gets to the CVV.</p>

<p>This feels like one of the first examples of forms that are designed specifically and contextually for mobile. The way that they’ve condensed this form lets you get a high-level overview in an extremely small space - and walks you through it in a linear fashion. I haven’t seen any testing to see if users can get through this easily (which makes me a little shy to endorse it), but it is a good example of <em>optimizing form experiences for small screens</em>.</p>

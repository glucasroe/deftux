<p>Hi. Yes, this project died, but I&rsquo;m resurrecting it after some encouragement from some people that I&rsquo;m very thankful for. <a href="http://glucasroe.com/failing-projects-and-the-friendly-tyranny-of-the-internet/">I wrote a dumb little blog post about it if you&rsquo;re interested in my personal life</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to the next 77 days of good UX :)</p>

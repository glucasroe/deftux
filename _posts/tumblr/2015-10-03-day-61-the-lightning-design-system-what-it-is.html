<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com">The Lightning Design System</a> is the pattern library and styleguide for Salesforce.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: If you’ve been watching the design community, you may have noticed a huge focus on pattern libraries. The Lightning Design System made a big splash, and the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/">US Web Design Standards</a> were greeted with intense fervor.</p>

<p>These design systems are so fantastic because they are moving us away from designing pages. The challenge with experience is that it’s not defined by a single point; it’s the <em>sum total of an entire relationship</em>. Designing individual views is too small, too limited in scope to shape a user’s <em>experience</em>.</p>

<p>Lightning Design System’s designers took time not just to document <em>what</em> the implementation looks like, but also to go into great detail to explain <em>how</em>. There are numerous types of documentation for each pattern: visual, code, and verbal. Each version of it explains what it is, how you get it, and why they did it this way. It’s broad and detailed, but without being so precise that it requires designers to implement every decision.</p>

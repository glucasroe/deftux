<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When animating elements on a slide in Keynote, you can open a “Build Order” control that lets you preview the animations, reorder them, and edit them quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: A constant design goal of mine is balancing granularity with mass editing tools. Allowing flexibility while clearly indicating what is possible is incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>In this case, Keynote gives you an immensely powerful and flexible animation structure without locking you into a single method of working with it. Animations are created on the element level, tweaking functions and setting the build order via a dropdown in the right information panel. It’s useful, but very specific to the individual elements and doesn’t give you a sense of the slide as a whole.</p>

<p>This interface gives you that high-level view, allowing you to focus specifically on the animation order and methods at a slide level. The “Preview” button is brilliantly implemented, showing you an accurate representation of slide state and also showing you <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> the animations are happening. Selecting the animations for the individual elements also selects the element on the stage, showing you which element you are engaging with.</p>

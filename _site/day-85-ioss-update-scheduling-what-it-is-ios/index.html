        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: iOS will automatically download updates in the background, and then offer to install them when the device is charging that evening.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Asking a user to update their device is always a bizarre ritual. We’re asking them to put it down and stop using it for a while, but the only time that they’ll see the message is when they’re already engaged. Seems counterproductive, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>This decision makes so much sense because for the <em>vast majority of the user base</em>, the device will be left unattended in the 5-hour window. This pop-up is effective because of how spare the copy is: direct but still warning of potential pitfalls (i.e. <em>while connected to power</em>)</p>

<p>Pushing programmatic and automated functions into a user’s downtime is a great way to make our products not feel like a chore to manage, or an errand to check off.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Google Fi sent me a package a few weeks after I signed up for their service. It thanked me for being an early customer, and included a set of headphones, an external battery, and a case for my phone.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Giving a gift <a href="https://goodui.org/#2">always goes over well</a>. What you give—and how you give it—matter a lot, though. Google Fi hit it out of the park here.</p>

<p>First, they didn’t tell me to expect anything. I didn’t receive a shipping notice; it just appeared on my doorstep on Monday. I was genuinely surprised. The language throughout the box is friendly and direct: “Hello again” as a greeting, “Thanks for being here from the beginning” as an explanation on the bottom of the lid, and cute labels on each item. The headphones are an odd design that allow you to plug in a secondary pair, and say “Turn airdrum solos into airdrum duets.” The battery pack and case say “100% all natural juice for your phone” and “Even phones need hugs.”</p>

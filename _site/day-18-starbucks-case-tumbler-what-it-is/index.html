        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Starbucks recently released a line of tumblers in which you can customize the case. The labels on these use alternating color and blind deboss to indicate they are parts of a set.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to indicate to users when they need to pay attention. In software, we have a lot of ways to handle this by locking down the system until certain requirements have been fulfilled. We don&rsquo;t always have that option though.</p>

<p>This little set is more subtle than slapping big numbers on the tumbler and case, but it provides the same effect. The blind deboss is different, it catches attention enough that you realize that there&rsquo;s another level of information. Put next to eachother, the relationship is clear instantly.</p>

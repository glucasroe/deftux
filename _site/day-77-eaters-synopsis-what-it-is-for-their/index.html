        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: For their <a href="http://ny.eater.com/2015/10/14/9517747/danny-meyer-no-tipping-restaurants">feature length articles</a>, Eater provides a synopsis with footnotes that link to the sections of the story.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: We operate in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">attention economy</a>. The first time that I ever saw a feature like this, it was on a major news site. They condensed the article into a few bullet points, which allowed me to form a strong opinion without actually reading the nuance of the text. Not exactly encouraging the best behavior.</p>

<p>This approach is so valuable because it offers a <em>way to process the full article</em>. It is more than just an overview, it’s also an index that gives me the structure of the article and what information I’ll find inside. The visually loud and important footnotes encourage interaction and exploration, and the smooth scroll effect gives me an overview of the article as I pan back and forth between the overview and the text.</p>

<p>Instead of just stripping meaning from the text, Eater gives the user the ability to choose what they want to see and allows a combination of browsing and reading.</p>

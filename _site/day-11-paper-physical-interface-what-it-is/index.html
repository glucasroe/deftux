        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Paper is an application for sketching and diagramming. It uses an extended metaphore of pages and books to navigate and display drawings.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Tablets are fundamentally different devices than computers. Our input methods, where we use them (usually), our method of engagement, and our emotional state are all different. Consequentially, some of the decades of baggage from designing mouse and keyboard interfaces doesn&rsquo;t hold up well in touch.</p>

<p>Paper does a wonderful job at relating itself to a different metaphor, books. It brings physicality to this interface to help orient users, and does some pretty heavy handholding when you first begin with it. The little gif above shows how you can move shapes around like a post-it note (including whatever&rsquo;s drawn on it), and then how pinching motions bring you out of page view and then out of book view. Part of the reason this gestural interface is so successful is because of the requirements of a drawing surface - You don&rsquo;t want an interface, you want a canvas.</p>

        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When moving multiple files, Google Docs animates them into a stack, and then shows the stack interacting with its supporting interface pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: In the recent article <a href="https://medium.com/startups-venture-capital/your-ui-isn-t-a-disney-movie-703f7fbd24d2#.jh8vg9b3c">Your UI isn’t a Disney Movie</a>, Sophie Paxton brings up wonderful points about gratuitous animation in interfaces. She has a great point: animations that aren’t providing meaning are information noise, and end up wasting the user’s time.</p>

<p>In this case though, Google Drive uses small and smart animations to indicate the state of the UI. When working with a web interface, our users don’t usually understand the space of possibilities. Especially in web-based file systems, helping our users understand <em>how</em> they need to interact with the system is vital.The visual stacking happens quickly, and does a wonderful job of showing you where your files are going and what is happening to them.</p>

        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: At the beginning of each chapter, there&rsquo;s a breakdown of important subheads, a small line diagram, and a full color spread.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The books that Rosenfeld publishes walk a fine line between reference manual and professional development. These chapter leadins are so successful because they so accurately consider <strong>why</strong> the consumer is reading this book. The full color spread makes it easy to find these pages as you flip through the book. Detailed headings give an overview of the chapter contents, as well as their locations. My favorite bit is the line graph though, which gives you an example of the relative length of this chapter to the entire book. It&rsquo;s similar to a Kindle saying &ldquo;3 hours left in this book,&rdquo; but more subtle and beautiful.</p>

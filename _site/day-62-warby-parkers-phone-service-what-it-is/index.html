        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When I ordered glasses last year, I called for some clarification. Someone picked up the phone after one ring.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Experience is grander than interface. Warby Parker’s site is nice. I didn’t have many problems ordering things. Their home try-on service was so amazing that it spawned a whole line of copycats.</p>

<p>However, their commitment to good customer service (or, if you will, customer experience) shows in the way that they structure their entire company. Having someone pick up the phone as soon as it rang shocked me so much that I was momentarily speechless. I had to apologize because I was in the middle of looking up my order email because I expected to be on hold.</p>

<p>When you are designing experiences, it isn’t enough to just take business decisions and turn them into interfaces. The interfaces will not fulfill every need, and then the user will fall back on those business decisions, for instance when they contact support. Consequently, we have to root all of our arguments in a user-centered philosophy to help us advocate for users through their <em>entire relationship</em> with our product.</p>

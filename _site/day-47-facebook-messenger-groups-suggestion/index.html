        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: In Facebook Messenger, when you are lame like me and don&rsquo;t have any group messages going, it gives you suggestions for starting one, such as &ldquo;For school friends?&rdquo; &ldquo;For a party?&rdquo; and &ldquo;For funny photos?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Every app has certain &ldquo;must include&rdquo; features that just make no sense to the average user. I think this might be one of those cases.</p>

<p>Facebook could have gone with the default and just made a single &ldquo;new group&rdquo; button, but the addition of this explanatory text is really what we&rsquo;re talking about here. These small bits of microcopy serve two roles, they tell me <em>how</em> I can use this feature (and what it&rsquo;s for) while also spurring the action.</p>

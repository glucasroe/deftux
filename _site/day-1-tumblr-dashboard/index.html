        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: This is the second step after I create my account, after skipping the &ldquo;follow these blogs&rdquo; step. Suggested content appears all around, but this is clearly the center of the interface.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The animation is subtle, but friendly. It draws me to the center of the screen, uses casual and accessible language, and indicates interactivity. The dashed lines act as a wireframe to indicate how content will come in if I follow blogs, avatar and posts. There are also more subtle things going on, like introducing you to the unique icon that Tumblr uses for &ldquo;Link.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This ends up for a great launch point to start my blog. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like a huge deal, it feels natural, easy, and directed.</p>

        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Tasty (and Buzzfeed cooking) use this style of video where it is filmed from overheard with ingredient overlays and ramping between important steps in the cooking process.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: These videos are largely designed to be shared through social media platforms, and it shows in the way that they are filmed. They are essentially unbranded (They have no celebrity associated with them), and are very simply focused on the steps required and the end result.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoy that the overhead camera shows you the entire process - but it also shows you the specific points that need attention. You get an idea on how much time it takes and how difficult it is because there are no cuts, just speed changes. You see how the ingredients change over time and what it needs to look like - but without any cruft or explanations.</p>

<p>Another nice touch is answering a question before it&rsquo;s asked. This particular recipe calls for a spice mix. After explaining the amount needed, the video cuts itself in half and shows you how to build the mix yourself (just in case you aren&rsquo;t the type to have a jar of Cajun Spices sitting about.) The visualization feels paranthetical, it <em>unpacks</em> an item and shows you how it&rsquo;s made without losing context in the greater recipe.</p>

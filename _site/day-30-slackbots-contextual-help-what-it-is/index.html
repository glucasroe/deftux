        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Slack somewhat recently announced their emoji response system, a great way to cut down on superfluous messages. When you respond to a message with just an emoji, slackbot tells you about the new feature.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Telling users about new features can be difficult. Release notes aren&rsquo;t very interesting, so most of the time people don&rsquo;t pay a lot of attention to them.</p>

<p>Instead of beating you over the head with the idea, (or expecting you to find it in the release notes) slackbot gives you a quick message that tells you how to use the feature. It only shows up for the first few times you use it (I had to go find an old, unused Slack because it wouldn&rsquo;t come up in any of the ones I use on a regular basis) and it only shows up when you respond with just an emoji. The subtle details matter here too, slackbot indicates that the message is only visible to the user through a color shift and short disclaimer.</p>

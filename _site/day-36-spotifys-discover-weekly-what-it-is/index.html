        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Every Monday, Spotify gives me 30 songs in a playlist based off of things that it thinks I&rsquo;ll like.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Do you remember the magical, early days of Pandora? The simple idea that you could listen to a radio station based off of a song or artist you enjoyed was revolutionary. It had its flaws though, the most crucial of which I wryly nicknamed “Pandora Decay,” where your favorite station, if left untended, would slowly wander away from its intended seed until you didn’t even recognize its starting point anymore. You could manage it with carefully tending the stream, thumbsing up and down songs and moving them to different stations, but in the end that was just more work. I wasn’t looking for something to tend, I just wanted music that I like.</p>

<p>Discover Weekly is a different idea in a similar space. Spotify sees what you listen to, so it reaches across the breadth of your taste from your listening and picks songs that it thinks that you’ll like. It averages about a 50% hit rate for me; Half the time I enjoy the song and save it. (as you can see in the screenshot) By comparison, Spotify’s radio function gets about 30%, even with careful curation.</p>

<p>The beauty of this is in its unassuming nature. The songs are just there, not a radio station I’m not allowed to browse through, but a playlist—a mixtape from a friend. <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2015/07/22/discovering-spotifys-discover-weekly/">I’m not the only one to feel this way about it</a>. Injecting it into the existing feature, playlists, gets me more intwined with a powerful feature, playlists are meant to be shared. They’re the new mixtape! Not only that, but as I learn that Spotify will literally <em>find</em> me music without me asking, it reenforces their value proposition. I don’t just want to keep paying for Spotify so I can listen to Bell Biv Devoe 15 times in a row, I also now am counting on it noticing and giving me some other early 90’s hip hop.</p>

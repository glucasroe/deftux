        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you hit step goal in Google Fit, it celebrates by sending you a notification. When you load it up, it counts your steps and then gives you a little firework (with a little horn sound!)</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I admit to a high level of skepticism when it comes health tracking apps and changing behavior. It&rsquo;s not fun to be shamed into walking more, so celebrating the successes are important.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hit the goal all that frequently. The times that I do, it&rsquo;s worth some celebration! By contrast, I&rsquo;ve gotten an email every week from Moto Fit that begins with &ldquo;Everyone has an off week&rdquo; - mainly because I don&rsquo;t wear my watch on Saturdays or Sundays (so it thinks that I lie in bed all day or something.) The fanfare matches how I feel about it, so it&rsquo;s a great time to show a little flair.</p>

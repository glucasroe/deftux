<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you are traveling and getting stuck in traffic, Google Maps now tease apart the time added by the traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: When we were driving back from Cedar Point a few weeks ago, we noticed that our &ldquo;time to home&rdquo; kept spiking up. Normally we would just be consigned to sit in traffic, but the tools that Google now offers through maps gave us all of the information we needed to make decisions. While we could just trust that the suggested route is faster, the little badge helps prove the point, and makes the user feel like they have control over the situation.</p>

<p>These little badges have also been really helpful at helping contextualize the traffic that I deal with on a daily commute. Instead of just knowing &ldquo;The traffic is bad,&rdquo; Google now quantifies how bad the traffic is, enabling me to make the best decisions possible.</p>

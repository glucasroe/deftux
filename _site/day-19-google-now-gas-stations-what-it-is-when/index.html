        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When travelling home from Philadelphia this past weekend, I brought up Google Now. It showed me a list of gas stations off of my route, and the amount of time the detour would take.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: It&rsquo;s been fascinating to watch Google make changes to Now as it&rsquo;s evolved as a product. When Now first started, it only had the ability to tell you things that were near to you. Useful, sure, but not so much when you&rsquo;re speeding down an interstate.</p>

<p>This use case is an exact compliment to my needs, it was exactly what my wife and I needed as we travelled down the interstate. The biggest challenge is I don&rsquo;t know how to <em>make it appear</em>, but Google guessed correctly and made it surface at the right time.</p>

<p>Now I just need it to do the same thing for coffee shops</p>

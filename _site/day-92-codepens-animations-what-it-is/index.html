        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Codepen’s web editor animates states when showing the settings panel, and when changing the layout of the screens.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Having an interface tell you how to use it is… well, generally pretty lame. One of my favorite “Not actually UX but has the same ethos” videos is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM">Sequelitis - Megaman Classic vs. Mega Man X</a> (<em>Note</em>: This video is profane, inappropriate, and frequently in <strong>very</strong> poor taste. Watch at your own risk.) One of the main points that the author makes is that Mega Man X teaches you how to play the game by letting you play it with carefully considered constraints. He has this fantastic graph of “Yeah I get it” over time:</p>

<p>Codepen uses animations to teach you the relationship between the interfaces, and the flexibility in editing your settings. The settings window pops down from the top right, seeming to originate from the large “Settings” button. The relationship between the Settings Panel and the smaller Settings cogs becomes clear after a few clicks, and you can feel the flexibility that the interface allows you (That is, you aren’t tied into a single path to get to the specific section of settings.)</p>

<p>Animating from a point of origin is a topic that is frequently touched on in Material Design, but it is vital in any design language. Any animation adds meaning, so we should always harness its ability to <em>clarify</em> our work.</p>

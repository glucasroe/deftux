<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Prune is an an atmospheric and haunting game about growing your tree to reach light. The animations are used instead of instructions to indicate to the user how to navigate.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Believe it or not, I had never considered how I would move back and forth between the categories of levels before making this gif. The animation as you change worlds led me to think I could probably just pan back and forth, and behold, I can!</p>

<p>Prune has a remarkable economy of text, (they don&rsquo;t want to violate the spare environment) so it is a wonderful example of visual explanation. Each state that you can arrive to has an entrance and an exit animation that orients you to where you are and what is available to you.</p>

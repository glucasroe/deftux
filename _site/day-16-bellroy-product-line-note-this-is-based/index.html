        <p><em>Note</em>: This is based on an earlier version of the Bellroy website which you can see at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140209075825/http://bellroy.com/wallets/slim-sleeve-wallet">archive.org</a></p>

<p><strong>What is is</strong>: Bellroy is a steadily growing line of &ldquo;every day carry&rdquo; items. They began with wallets, which is still the majority of their product line. When they just sold wallets, they arranged their products on a continuum of features, going from &ldquo;Slimmest&rdquo; to &ldquo;Most features.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Product lines can be difficult to explain well to an end user. How do you go about showing the difference between the products and helping the user identify the right solution for their needs?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come back to this particular idea so many times because of how breathtakingly <em>clear</em> it was to me when I was purchasing a wallet from this company. I instantly knew what tradeoffs I was making, and felt like I had a good sense of accomodating my needs. The categorization above the wallets functioned as a breakpoint, helping me determine where exactly my needs lay.</p>

<p>The secondary effect was helping me &ldquo;fuzzy find&rdquo; what I wanted. While I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly which wallet was right for me, having them displayed in a range like this helped me determine <em>what I didn&rsquo;t need</em> right off the bat. I spent very little time looking above the &ldquo;Hide and Seek&rdquo; or below the &ldquo;Slim Sleeve&rdquo; because the range defined where my dividing line was for features that I wanted or needed.</p>

<p>While I was sad to see them iterate away from it, it&rsquo;s great to see that they didn&rsquo;t let a great idea hinder the growth of their product line. Clinging to this narrative wouldn&rsquo;t have made sense when they added phone cases or a more rugged line (The features are different, not just more)</p>

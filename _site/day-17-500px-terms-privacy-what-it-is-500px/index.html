        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: 500px is a photo sharing and discovery site. Their <a href="https://500px.com/terms">terms and conditions</a> are a 2 column page, the left column is all the legal-ese required to run a large site, and they then explain it on the right.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: EULA&rsquo;s and legal text in general are terrible experiences. If each interpersonal relationship began with a 10 minute recitation of what you were agreeing to by entering into this relationship, being a hermit would be much more socially acceptable.</p>

<p>Some products decide to address this by shaming the user into reading the EULA that they&rsquo;ve agreed to sight unseen. While it makes a product developer feel better, it doesn&rsquo;t really encourage anyone to enter the situation with more knowledge. 500px takes a different route, it gets that you <strong>want</strong> to understand what you&rsquo;re agreeing to, and then gives you the ability to bridge that gap.</p>

<p>The brilliant part of this design is in the juxtaposition. Instead of just writing a long document and then a simplified version, laying it side by side makes me feel as a user that this is an accurate translation. The large copy and short sentences make it easy to scan and understand. It gives me a quicker way to get the same information, which is brilliant.</p>

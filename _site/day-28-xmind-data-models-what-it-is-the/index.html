        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: The mindmapping tool <a href="https://www.xmind.net/">XMind</a> creates its data set in such a way that you can copy and paste data between it and a spreadsheet, like excel.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is good</strong>: I know I&rsquo;m running the risk of sounding like I&rsquo;m just trying to sell this product, but hear me out. For about 2 years, I tried to find something that would just create a flow diagram from an excel file. I even tried building it on my own in Axure at one point. (with hilariously limited success)</p>

<p>Everything that I found was incredibly rigid. There were some things that showed promise, like <a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_helpresources.html">yED</a> or <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com">LucidChart</a>, but in each case, I had to format my excel file in some arcane fashion. I did it in LucidChart at one point for a large navigation, and it took me about 3 hours. It sucked.</p>

<p>When I discovered that this product just let me work with my data <em>in my own mental model</em>, I was so excited I almost cried. I danced around for an entire afternoon. I copied it back and forth repeatedly just to watch it happen. Allow me to remind you, this is for a program that draws a chart.</p>

<p>When I read posts like <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3042849/delightful-interaction-design-needs-to-die">this one &ldquo;Delightful Interaction Design Needs to Die&rdquo;</a>, I&rsquo;m reluctantly in agreement. True delight doesn&rsquo;t come from a widget animating unexpectedly, that only provokes surprise. Delight comes from a something fitting into my needs, snapping into my mental model, and extending my ability to pursue my goals.</p>

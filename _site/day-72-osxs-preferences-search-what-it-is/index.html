        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you search for an item in OSX’s System Preferences, it gives you suggestions and highlights the relevant categories. When you select an item, it flashes the category before opening it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: For search-heavy users, having a helpful suggestive search is enough. As someone who uses search a lot, I hammer in a term and hit a suggestion as my first attempt at finding something. These plain-language suggestions highlight the categories as I mouse over them, which helps me understand the difference between similarly-named terms.</p>

<p>The reason that this is so effective is that it <em>uses the search to teach browsing users where things are</em>. If you are a user who prefers browsing, after a period of not finding what you are looking for, you use the search field. Now the interface shows you where you can find it next time. It orients you to the categorization so that you can use your preferred method in the future.</p>

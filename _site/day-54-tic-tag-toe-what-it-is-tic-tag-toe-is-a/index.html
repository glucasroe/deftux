        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Tic TAG Toe is a tagging game from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seeyoucloud.readingstatspocket">Reading Stats in your Pocket</a>, a third party app that tells statistics about your Pocket Queue. It presents you five random items from your queue, and has you select tags for them.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: What sort of behavior do you want to <em>encourage</em> in your users? This app needs some polish, but the goal is brilliant. I have somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 items currently in my Pocket queue. The majority of them don&rsquo;t have tags. I&rsquo;ve spent time going through and tagging items in order, but it just feels like a drag. Bleh. No thanks.</p>

<p>This little feature is great because it&rsquo;s just 5 items! That will take just a minute, right? It escorts you 5 random untagged items in your queue, and suggests some tags or lets you pick your own. It then encourages you to go for another round. Even if the execution could be improved, the idea itself is a solid example of <em>managing complexity</em> for the user.</p>

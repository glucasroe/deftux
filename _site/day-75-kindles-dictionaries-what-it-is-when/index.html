        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you select a word on a Kindle, it defines it either with its internal dictionary, with X-Ray, which is contextual to the book, or with Wikipedia.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: The main complaint that I hear about Kindles is that they aren’t books. Kindles aren’t books. The change in form makes them entirely different from books, and we use them in different ways. Amazon clearly wants to make the Kindle as good as it can be (even if not bookish) and this lookup feature is a brilliant example of the sort of things that books cannot accomplish.</p>

<p>Highlighting a single word causes the Kindle to automatically look it up. You’ll see in this case that it first selects the “X-Ray” tab in the modal window. X-Ray is a feature in texts that you buy from Amazon in which it catalogs larger ideas and links them to multiple spots in the text. In this case, the Kindle notices that the word that I selected is defined in X-Ray, so it shows it to me first. Since the X-Ray result is more contextually relevant, it is most likely to be what I’m looking for.</p>

<p>The dictionaries themselves are useful, but when you are connected to the internet you also have the ability to pull up a relevant Wikipedia article. This is incredibly useful when reading historical works or other texts with proper nouns that are unlikely to be found in a dictionary.</p>

<p>Instead of just making a device that tries to mimic a book as much as possible, Amazon extends the functionality of the text. Reading on a Kindle is reading hypertext that hasn’t experienced the tyranny of graphic design; it retains much of the functionality without being concerned about colors, layout, or being flashy.</p>

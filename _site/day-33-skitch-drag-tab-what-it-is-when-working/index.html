<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When working in Skitch, there&rsquo;s a small tab that when dragged, becomes a manipulatable version of your file. This file can be dragged and dropped into your file system.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Skitch is generally a great excercise in doing something fast and getting out of the way. Its toolset is limited, and everything revolves around quickly grabbing something, annotating it, and getting it into your file system.</p>

<p>Skitch understands its own context, you typically boot it up in the <em>middle</em> of a task flow. Instead of requiring you to drive through a standard save dialog, Skitch gets that you&rsquo;re probably already looking at what you want and where you want to put it, so it gives you the fastest way possible to accomplish that.</p>

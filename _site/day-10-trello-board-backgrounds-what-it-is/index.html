        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When setting up a new Trello board, you can set a background for it. There&rsquo;s also a little die that lets you randomize the board background.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Trello walks a fine line as a brand. On the one hand, they&rsquo;re playful, silly, and earnest. Their mascot is a Husky named Taco. C'mon. On the other hand, their service is used for everything from home organization (which fits the brand well) to critical business processes (in which the brand could feel pointless and frivolous.) Consequentially, they take a light touch with the sillyness in the actual interface.</p>

<p>Here though, the board backround really isn&rsquo;t that consequential, and they get that. The randomization function is handled quietly and simply, and with a little zest of fun. It&rsquo;s a great example of an easter egg that <strong>enhances</strong> functionality without hindering expert workflows.</p>

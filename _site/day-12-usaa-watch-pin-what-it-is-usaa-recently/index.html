        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: USAA recently released an Android Wear update to their app, which lets you see account balance on your watch. The PIN entry system has a large keyboard, and a ring lights up around the watchface to indicate how many digits you&rsquo;ve entered.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Interactions on wearable screens are tough because of real estate. The tiny screen and low resolution leaves it difficult to communicate, and the interfaces are highly gestural to combat this.</p>

<p>This interface is a great example of maximizing real-estate and making the experience as painless as possible. The glowing ring is quickly apparent, and shows error state when the pin is incorrect.</p>

        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Spotify upgrades itself in the background, but it needs a restart in order to apply it. The way they tell you about it is a little banner that says “Hello. We’ve got a new version of Spotify ready for you. Restart now to make it yours.”</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: I don’t think I need to do much consensus building for us all to agree that updates are annoying. Developers have gotten better at making updates less painful for users by moving them to the background (Like Chrome, or iOS and Android auto updates) but it still breaks down sometimes and requires something from the user, like a restart or an acceptance of new permissions.</p>

<p>Spotify provokes a sense of ownership in how they tell you about this change. Instead of shaming you (Like Chrome does) or blocking you from using it, (I’m looking at you, Blizzard) Spotify makes me feel like this is something that I would want to do.</p>

<p>While it would be better to tell me what new benefits this upgrade brings, there are only so many times that I want to read “Fixes random bugs in 1% of our userbase.”</p>

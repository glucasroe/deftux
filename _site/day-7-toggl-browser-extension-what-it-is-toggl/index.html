<p><strong>What it is</strong>: Toggl is a simple, web based, time tracking app. They make a browser extension that places a small button in a variety of different web apps like Trello, Jira, and Gmail. Clicking the button pulls the relevant text from whatever the button is near, and starts a time entry for it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: There are <strong>so</strong> many products available. There have been a wave of recent businesses that have made product integrations a central part of their strategy, like Slack or Stripe. Toggl has API integration as well, but it also has this lighter weight browser extension.</p>

<p>The beauty of this extension is that it doesn&rsquo;t overcomplicate the idea behind timetracking. It gets that you are just trying to start an entry, lets you pick a few options, and then gets out of the way. It also tracks state in both the button and on the favicon, showing me that everything worked correctly. It&rsquo;s quiet but efficient.</p>

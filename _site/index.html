          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When your Tumblr account goes inactive, they send you an email asking if you’d like to keep your username.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: I figured that since I started this blog with talking about Tumblr, I might as well end it that way as well (And since this account will be going inactive, it just seemed so <em>perfect</em>)</p>

<p>First, note the conversational tone. Tumblr isn’t begging to have you back (Which some companies do, and it’s just straight up weird.) It very clearly tells you that your content isn’t disappearing, you’ll just lose rights to your amazing and unique username.</p>

<p>The business decision behind this is so amazing that I want to shake someone’s hand for it. This is such a great way to handle the scourge of inactive accounts—allowing new users to grab names without invoking paranoia in the less active.</p>

<p>After you hit the “I’m still me” button, it requires you to reset your password. Not only is this good for security, it also is a pretty intelligent guess that you won’t remember your password if you haven’t signed in for months. It gives a small barrier to cross too, so it isn’t trivial to squat on a ton of usernames.</p>

<p>That’s the last one, folks. Thanks for coming along for the ride.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you mouse over a username on Twitter, it pops up a small card that gives you information on their profile and allows you to follow them.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Tooltips are such a fantastic way to dig deeper without breaking context. In this case, Twitter provides me with just enough information that I get a good understanding of who I’m moused over. There are a handful of links scattered through this tooltip that navigate me to different parts of the profile (many of which are colored the “link color” that is active on the given page.) The follow button’s different treatment indicates the different action, and the immediate state change gives me a great way to find more content and relevant users on Twitter.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Every so often, this HP printer (a Color Laserjet 4700) prints out a page with instructions that is used to clean the rollers.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: The printer spat out this page without any prompting after a particularly large print run that I did.</p>

<p>This decision is so smart to me because it <em>gave me the tool that I needed at exactly the time I needed it</em>. Instead of blocking future action with an alert and requiring me to clean the printer before moving forward, it simply gave me this page with a few concise directions. It didn’t railroad my task or require me to go get a special cleaning sheet from somewhere else. Instead, the designers and engineers used the limited elements available to accomplish the task.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Any part that is used to disassemble a Dyson DC50 is a bright, solid red.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Just as a note of clarity, occasionally people use <em>affordance</em> when they mean <em>signifier</em>. In this case, the affordance is mechanism that allows me to disassemble the vacuum, while the signifier is the bright red plastic.</p>

<p>The fact that this vacuum can be so thoroughly disassembled without tools is itself a feat of fantastic, user centered design. The bright red plastic mechanisms make it self evident. I bought this vacuum refurbished and it didn’t come with a manual, yet I could fully disassemble it just by looking for red pieces.</p>

<p>The red pieces also offer a way to navigate the user manual. If you look carefully, you’ll see small pops of red on the manual printout that I have the assembly resting on. In each case, the vacuum itself is rendered in monochrome <em>except for the piece that you need which is bright red</em>. There’s no ambiguity about what you should use and when.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Kanger Nebox uses temperature instead of wattage as its user settable scale.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: A good friend of mine replaced smoking with vaping about a year ago. In the past year, I’ve watched him sell or attempt to sell a wide variety of people on the various systems that he uses. Observing the faces of his intended mentees, I often see a pretty familiar look: “This is complicated.”</p>

<p>There’s a lot to keep track of when you go from smoking to vaping. You learn a lot of new terms about electricity, like Ohms, watts, and amperage. It feels complicated, which is important when you are dealing with potentially dangerous levels of energy or batteries shorting out.</p>

<p>He showed me this box today, with the tremendous difference of listing <em>temperature</em> as its settable parameter. Most boxes require you to set <em>wattage</em>, which doesn’t necessarily have a direct relationship with temperature. Setting the temperature requires some extra safety features, if you just hold down the button it taps out and doesn’t let you set anything on fire, but it’s built in and doesn’t require you to know that up front.</p>

<p>The important aspect here is <em>using a metric new users understand</em>. Wattage isn’t something the average person deals with, so they have to learn what it means and what relationships it has towards heat and power draw. Temperature is much more accessible, and feels like something that you can be a part of, even if you are an amateur.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: In the smash hit podcast Song Exploder, host Hrishikesh Hirway rarely if ever appears on the final recording of the interview.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: There is a brilliant editorial position that is embedded in this decision. As you listen to these stories, the flow of them becomes enveloping. You step into the world of the artist’s decisions, and become part of their process. It almost feels like Hrishikesh sits down and the story comes pouring out of them.</p>

<p>It’s clear that this isn’t the case though. At times, he leaves in the audio of himself asking a question when the context is important, or when the musician reacts to his question. In this <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hrishihirway/song-exploder-no-18-the#t=5:38">full 15 minute episode</a> you hear him ask one question at about 5:40. This isn’t an accident, it’s a purposeful choice in the structuring of the program.</p>

<p>I don’t know if there’s a precedent set for it, but the closest thing that I can think of is ghost writing a biography. Hrishikesh gets that he isn’t the focus, but that exact understanding is what makes the final work so powerful, and makes him so perfect for the role.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: UserOnboard gives you a modal window to sign up for their mailing list at the end of a slideshow.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: I spend more time than I’m really proud of shouting about modal windows. If you’d like to provoke a lot of colorful language and my immediate departure, just throw a modal in my face in the middle of what I’m doing.</p>

<p>This, friends, is how you ask people to sign up for your mailing list without being an ass. First, and most importantly, <em>the modal appears upon user action</em>. This is <em>not</em> something that comes up in the middle of my task, I literally have to click on something to trigger the window. Second, the modal appears <em>after I have consumed the value from the site</em>. Samuel could have put this in the middle of the slideshow, but he didn’t because that’s insane and narcissistic behavior. Third, the modal window tells me <em>exactly what I can expect to happen</em>, and indicates how and why my email will be used with clear value propositions and purpose.</p>

<p>If you are resorting to slapping your user in the face with an unexpected sign up form, <em>you are wrong</em>. I can’t think of a simpler way to put it without expletives or name calling. Don’t do it.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When a lesson ends in Skillshare, it autoplays the next lesson. In the meantime, it tells you what you just watched, the next lesson up, and gives you robust play options.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you might notice a habit of me enjoying fairly verbose interfaces. To be clear, I don’t <em>necessarily</em> prefer copy-heavy interfaces, but in the words of Luke W., <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945">obvious always wins</a>.</p>

<p>Skillshare does a lot here to tell you the current system state, where you are in it, and what is about to happen. It doesn’t expect you to intuit what’s happening, but gives you all of the details and controls.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Codepen’s web editor animates states when showing the settings panel, and when changing the layout of the screens.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Having an interface tell you how to use it is… well, generally pretty lame. One of my favorite “Not actually UX but has the same ethos” videos is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM">Sequelitis - Megaman Classic vs. Mega Man X</a> (<em>Note</em>: This video is profane, inappropriate, and frequently in <strong>very</strong> poor taste. Watch at your own risk.) One of the main points that the author makes is that Mega Man X teaches you how to play the game by letting you play it with carefully considered constraints. He has this fantastic graph of “Yeah I get it” over time:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/M9kRewzz_pM/hqdefault.jpg" alt="“Yeah, I Get It” over time"/></p>

<p>Codepen uses animations to teach you the relationship between the interfaces, and the flexibility in editing your settings. The settings window pops down from the top right, seeming to originate from the large “Settings” button. The relationship between the Settings Panel and the smaller Settings cogs becomes clear after a few clicks, and you can feel the flexibility that the interface allows you (That is, you aren’t tied into a single path to get to the specific section of settings.)</p>

<p>Animating from a point of origin is a topic that is frequently touched on in Material Design, but it is vital in any design language. Any animation adds meaning, so we should always harness its ability to <em>clarify</em> our work.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Guides in Sketch have a constantly visible tooltip that tell you the exact pixel value it is placed on.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Visual design and our desire to make designs “Clean” can lead to a whole host of usability problems. I remember one designer in days of yore that I argued with repeatedly because they didn’t care for breadcrumb navigation. All of the research that I found supported out how useful and helpful breadcrumbs are, so we never quite saw eye to eye.</p>

<p>Sketch sacrifices some visual purity for the benefit of being declarative and obvious. Pixel values that I’m adding guides to are usually important, so having the values visible instead of requiring me to guess is a safe bet.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Blab is a livestreaming conversation platform that is closely integrated with Twitter. The members who are streaming have a small button on them that lets you follow them on Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Many new social products, like Meerkat or Product Hunt, are built heavily on top of existing social networks—usually Twitter. With these tight integrations comes a blurring of the lines between the two networks. They each become part of a unified experience that directly feeds into eachother.</p>

<p>Blab could have made a network of their own where you signed up for an account and followed people through their service (like Twitch for instance,) but instead they focused on the goal of their application—a live video multistream. The tight integration supports their goal, and so it lets them play to their strengths. They didn’t reinvent the wheel, but found a way to extend a successful product.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you navigate between different areas of Tinyletter’s web application, the search bar changes to indicate what it would be searching.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As a user, it can be really difficult to understand the scope of your possibilities. I saw this a lot when working in an agency, in the form of social networking icons. On different sites, these icons could serve a number of different purposes; sharing the page they were on, sharing the site in general, or even navigating to the company’s social properties.</p>

<p>Search can fall into the same trap, sometimes a search is for an entire site and other times it is on for the page that you’re on. In this case, the search being a part of the header makes it fit with Tinyletter’s minimalist design, but it <em>feels</em> like it might be a full site (or in this case, application) search.</p>

<p>With a simple addition of text, it not only reinforces where you are, but it tells you what you can expect to get out of the search. Note that on “Letters” it doesn’t just insert the section name into the search field, but clarifies with “Search Sent Letters.” This minor hint means that I can predict the outcome of my action, which increases my confidence in the interface and in my ability to work with it.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Sloan water saving handles are green, and have a label that indicate which direction you should push the handle to use the water saving function.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: This one feels a little out there, but bear with me. When things look the same, we don’t pay attention to them. They fade into the background and we use them automatically.</p>

<p>Usually, these water saving toilets use a circle cut in two halves. I have no idea what they mean, and I just guess at which of the two buttons to push. I’m wrong a lot.</p>

<p>In this case though, they use the interface I know. The combination of the color shift and the label immediately indicated that this should be used differently. The unifying element is the smart default though, when you pull the handle <em>towards you</em> starts a water saving flush. It’s a safe bet, and definitely the behavior that both the designer (and the store owner) want to encourage.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/index.html">CodeKit</a> is a utility application for preprocessing files and for a host of other supports for modern web development. When adding a project to CodeKit, you can drag and drop the folder onto the window. Dragging a folder onto the window highlights two areas: one to add as a project and the other to add as a framework.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: CodeKit is a Mac App. Macs are particularly suited to dragging and dropping; it’s part of the visual language of the system and is well-established in the user base.</p>

<p>I like this particular solution because of how clearly it shows state and suggests action. First, the top <em>drop</em> area is much larger than it appears. It extends to the title bar and the entire top section of the window. Its increased size and layout emphasize that this is the suggested action—most of the time, you’re adding projects, not frameworks.</p>

<p>CodeKit meets expectations by darkening the section you’re dropping into, but it also takes an extra step in being verbose about it. It highlights the name of the folder that you’re dragging, so in plain language you can see the outcome of your action.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When entering a password on Amazon’s mobile app, it is defaulted to show the password in plain text below the obscured password.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As an industry, we’ve pretty much settled that passwords are pretty terrible for usability, ease of use, and general experience. When we move the password field to a mobile screen, with its constraints on space and lack of tactile feedback, all of these problems are amplified.</p>

<p>These “View Password” toggles feel like a good solution, and they’re popping up with increasing regularity. This particular version of it is my favorite because it <em>shows the plain text password underneath the obscured version</em>. For users who are used to having their password obscured as they type, a plain text field gives them the wrong signal - it doesn’t look correct. Is it secure? Are they even on the password field right now?</p>

<p>This clarifies the relationship between the password and the plain text, and is a safer default, because it has the visual signifier that we’re used to.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: iOS will automatically download updates in the background, and then offer to install them when the device is charging that evening.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Asking a user to update their device is always a bizarre ritual. We’re asking them to put it down and stop using it for a while, but the only time that they’ll see the message is when they’re already engaged. Seems counterproductive, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>This decision makes so much sense because for the <em>vast majority of the user base</em>, the device will be left unattended in the 5-hour window. This pop-up is effective because of how spare the copy is: direct but still warning of potential pitfalls (i.e. <em>while connected to power</em>)</p>

<p>Pushing programmatic and automated functions into a user’s downtime is a great way to make our products not feel like a chore to manage, or an errand to check off.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When moving multiple files, Google Docs animates them into a stack, and then shows the stack interacting with its supporting interface pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: In the recent article <a href="https://medium.com/startups-venture-capital/your-ui-isn-t-a-disney-movie-703f7fbd24d2#.jh8vg9b3c">Your UI isn’t a Disney Movie</a>, Sophie Paxton brings up wonderful points about gratuitous animation in interfaces. She has a great point: animations that aren’t providing meaning are information noise, and end up wasting the user’s time.</p>

<p>In this case though, Google Drive uses small and smart animations to indicate the state of the UI. When working with a web interface, our users don’t usually understand the space of possibilities. Especially in web-based file systems, helping our users understand <em>how</em> they need to interact with the system is vital.The visual stacking happens quickly, and does a wonderful job of showing you where your files are going and what is happening to them.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><em>Note: This experience was recommended by my wife, Katelyn. Thanks Katelyn!</em></p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.mileiq.com/">MileIQ</a> is an application to help you keep track of your deductible mileage. It monitors your travel and gives you a breakdown of “Trips” which you categorize into “Business” and “Personal” by swiping. Longer swipes give you the ability to add metadata to the trips as you categorize them.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: This type of interface is now officially known as a “Tinder Swipe”—based off of the eponymous dating app. It’s a great application of the same idea in a different setting.</p>

<p>Reducing the amount of choices to a binary: “Business” or “Personal” is a wonderful statement of the app’s intent. Giving your user a simple, binary choice will always help them move through their data, especially when managing a long list of items. (Notice that she has over 100 drives to categorize)</p>

<p>The implementation of the longer swipe is ingenious. Some applications try to use longer swipes for different pieces of functionality. This is confusing because there isn’t usually a logical linkage between “Short swipe does x, long swipe does y.” There isn’t any map between the gesture and the outcome. This implementation spins it differently, swipe <em>direction</em> accomplishes the action, while longer swipes <em>give you more detail</em>. The mapping is very clear, a larger action in the same domain allows more functionality. Notice that it even maintains the state of the swiped out bar as it fades out the other screen elements.</p>

          <p><em>Note: This experience was recommended by a reader, who prefers to remain anonymous. Thanks reader!</em></p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://www.helloclue.com/index.html">Clue is an app for tracking your menstrual cycle</a>. It visualizes the cycle with a circle, and places ranges and data points on it that are positioned relative to different parts of the cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: When I received the glowing email that recommended this product, the main point was the application’s very simple visualization of time. I particularly enjoyed the way that Clue’s creators balanced ranges of time (colored bars around the border) with specific data points (small squares on the inside of the chart).</p>

<p>In the ensuing discussion about the visualization and what made it good, this minorly edited quote summed it up nicely: “Clue allows you an easy way to enter all the data, even providing you with suggestions of things that are related but you may not have thought to track otherwise (i.e. mood).  Then, they give all that data back to you in a way that makes you feel more informed about your period&hellip; Not only does it allow you to prepare for what&rsquo;s coming, but also it removes some of the fear caused by experiencing weird symptoms&hellip;  by showing you what&rsquo;s ‘normal’ for you.”</p>

<p>The combination of visualization and smart suggestion take something that is inherently hard to predict, and makes it <em>feel</em> more manageable, even when it isn’t.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you have an event coming up, Eventbrite sends you a notification. The notification has a QR code in it that serves as your ticket.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: When attending an event, you have a lot going on. Frequently, you are going to a place that you aren’t familiar with, and that brings a lot of complexity. Considering the complexity is usually managed via your phone (with Maps, Calendars, and messaging apps), being required to keep a ticket up on your phone is a liability.</p>

<p>This notification popped up just before the event, and as you can see, they actually <em>put the barcode for my ticket in the notification</em>. This inclusion means that if I was in the midst of navigating or communicating with others, I still have the ticket right there to quickly check in when I find the place.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When someone sends you a template from Lucidchart, it adds in a small gif that shows you all of the screens available in the template.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: This particular decision is so smart because it answers a very human question: “What is this?” In this particular case, the coworker who sent this to me hadn’t told me they were sending me something.</p>

<p>Instead of requiring some  leap of faith, Lucidchart gave me a smart preview that let me know what I would find when I opened the template. Also, I’m not entirely sure how they worked this out, but the image that showed the screens wasn’t blocked by Outlook initially, so I saw the preview even in my inbox’s default state.</p>

<p>Predicting the questions that people ask isn’t easy, but it adds so much value to a product. “What is this?” is especially important when dealing with notification emails, or other messages that weren’t initiated by user action.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When animating elements on a slide in Keynote, you can open a “Build Order” control that lets you preview the animations, reorder them, and edit them quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: A constant design goal of mine is balancing granularity with mass editing tools. Allowing flexibility while clearly indicating what is possible is incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>In this case, Keynote gives you an immensely powerful and flexible animation structure without locking you into a single method of working with it. Animations are created on the element level, tweaking functions and setting the build order via a dropdown in the right information panel. It’s useful, but very specific to the individual elements and doesn’t give you a sense of the slide as a whole.</p>

<p>This interface gives you that high-level view, allowing you to focus specifically on the animation order and methods at a slide level. The “Preview” button is brilliantly implemented, showing you an accurate representation of slide state and also showing you <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> the animations are happening. Selecting the animations for the individual elements also selects the element on the stage, showing you which element you are engaging with.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you tap command + q in Chrome, it doesn’t instantly close the app. Instead, it displays a banner which says “Hold ⌘Q to quit.”</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As a enthusiastic browser tab user, I am consistently hitting command + w to close tabs. Small challenge: next to the “w” on a keyboard is the “q,” and the system default for OSX is to quit the entire application when command + q is pressed. This usually means attempting to recover the ~30 or so sites that I have open at any given time. It was a consistent issue before Chrome introduced this feature.</p>

<p>This approach works because of its internal logic (i.e. you usually hit the wrong key when you’re in a hurry, so we can assume you won’t be holding it down) and the consistent message. Instead of just preventing the action, the system tells you <em>why</em> nothing happened when you pressed your key combination.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: We operate in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">attention economy</a>. The first time that I ever saw a feature like this, it was on a major news site. They condensed the article into a few bullet points, which allowed me to form a strong opinion without actually reading the nuance of the text. Not exactly encouraging the best behavior.</p>

<p>This approach is so valuable because it offers a <em>way to process the full article</em>. It is more than just an overview, it’s also an index that gives me the structure of the article and what information I’ll find inside. The visually loud and important footnotes encourage interaction and exploration, and the smooth scroll effect gives me an overview of the article as I pan back and forth between the overview and the text.</p>

<p>Instead of just stripping meaning from the text, Eater gives the user the ability to choose what they want to see and allows a combination of browsing and reading.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Frequently, really useful features are quite simple. Timing a break on saving a set is a pretty simple idea.</p>

<p>What makes this good is the flexibility and customization available. The time is easily changed, as are the notification settings. It verifies in triplicate that a timer has started. (The clock starts, the green banner slides down, and a notification appears) It also isn’t demanding about how you use the timer, but instead feeds the action into an existing feature.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you select a word on a Kindle, it defines it either with its internal dictionary, with X-Ray, which is contextual to the book, or with Wikipedia.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: The main complaint that I hear about Kindles is that they aren’t books. Kindles aren’t books. The change in form makes them entirely different from books, and we use them in different ways. Amazon clearly wants to make the Kindle as good as it can be (even if not bookish) and this lookup feature is a brilliant example of the sort of things that books cannot accomplish.</p>

<p>Highlighting a single word causes the Kindle to automatically look it up. You’ll see in this case that it first selects the “X-Ray” tab in the modal window. X-Ray is a feature in texts that you buy from Amazon in which it catalogs larger ideas and links them to multiple spots in the text. In this case, the Kindle notices that the word that I selected is defined in X-Ray, so it shows it to me first. Since the X-Ray result is more contextually relevant, it is most likely to be what I’m looking for.</p>

<p>The dictionaries themselves are useful, but when you are connected to the internet you also have the ability to pull up a relevant Wikipedia article. This is incredibly useful when reading historical works or other texts with proper nouns that are unlikely to be found in a dictionary.</p>

<p>Instead of just making a device that tries to mimic a book as much as possible, Amazon extends the functionality of the text. Reading on a Kindle is reading hypertext that hasn’t experienced the tyranny of graphic design; it retains much of the functionality without being concerned about colors, layout, or being flashy.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you wiggle your mouse quickly in OSX’s most recent update, the mouse pointer briefly becomes larger.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Besides being incredibly helpful when you’re in a multiscreen environment, (<em>Especially</em> when you are hooked up to a projector) the reason that this particular design is so effective is that it <em>mimics the current user behavior</em>. When you can’t find your mouse pointer, you shake it around because eyes are better adapted to noticing motion.</p>

<p>The decision here works because the user didn’t have to learn and remember a new behavior. Instead, the designers at Apple paid attention to the current behavior and took another step towards bridging the gap between the software and the user.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: This is a feature you’re familiar with, when you stick a limb (or item) in between the doors of an elevator, the doors re-open.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Ostensibly, the reason that this feature exists is for safety—and I enjoy not having to worry about being maimed in the mornings. In practice, though, it’s used as a hack to hold an elevator.</p>

<p>You can get incredible information through watching how people hack systems. In this case, when users need to hold an elevator door open, sticking an arm through the doors is much easier than finding a specific button. It’s reliable and easy, but it’s also a behavior that we learn from watching others.</p>

<p>The real reason that this is interesting, though, is that what the designers made as a <em>safety feature</em> has become a <em>standard use</em>. It’s a testament to how robust the feature is: we potentially disregard our bodily integrity for convenience because we <em>know</em> it will work.</p>

<p>Robust features (especially safety features) have this effect. You can see it in things like autosave functions. When you work with a product that has a robust autosave with historical capabilities (like Google Docs), it fundamentally changes how you interact with a filesystem. Whenever we produce something that is this robust and reliable, we open up entirely new possibilities for our users.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you search for an item in OSX’s System Preferences, it gives you suggestions and highlights the relevant categories. When you select an item, it flashes the category before opening it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: For search-heavy users, having a helpful suggestive search is enough. As someone who uses search a lot, I hammer in a term and hit a suggestion as my first attempt at finding something. These plain-language suggestions highlight the categories as I mouse over them, which helps me understand the difference between similarly-named terms.</p>

<p>The reason that this is so effective is that it <em>uses the search to teach browsing users where things are</em>. If you are a user who prefers browsing, after a period of not finding what you are looking for, you use the search field. Now the interface shows you where you can find it next time. It orients you to the categorization so that you can use your preferred method in the future.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Spotify upgrades itself in the background, but it needs a restart in order to apply it. The way they tell you about it is a little banner that says “Hello. We’ve got a new version of Spotify ready for you. Restart now to make it yours.”</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: I don’t think I need to do much consensus building for us all to agree that updates are annoying. Developers have gotten better at making updates less painful for users by moving them to the background (Like Chrome, or iOS and Android auto updates) but it still breaks down sometimes and requires something from the user, like a restart or an acceptance of new permissions.</p>

<p>Spotify provokes a sense of ownership in how they tell you about this change. Instead of shaming you (Like Chrome does) or blocking you from using it, (I’m looking at you, Blizzard) Spotify makes me feel like this is something that I would want to do.</p>

<p>While it would be better to tell me what new benefits this upgrade brings, there are only so many times that I want to read “Fixes random bugs in 1% of our userbase.”</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Typeform lets you create a form (or even multiple forms) before you ever sign up for an account.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: When your user lands on your site, it’s pretty rare that their first thought is “Oh man, hope I have to fill out a sign in form!” They have goals to accomplish, but we usually throw a sign up form in their face as the first thing. We hope that they’ve gleaned enough value from our marketing material to take that first step big step of signing up.</p>

<p>As our technology has progressed, this imperative <em>need</em> to sign up for everything is evaporating, and yet you still see it on almost every site. Not only does Typeform allow you to just start making a form, (with some minor interruptions, grumble grumble) it even <em>saves the form in a local session</em> so if you leave and come back, your work is still there. They message this with a small button with a subtle flash in the top right, saying “Save Account.”</p>

<p>Duolingo has recently taken this approach too, and it is so wonderful because it allows <em>demonstrated value</em>. I don’t have to fork over my credentials to see if this product will be useful. I can jump in and try it out and then sign up when I see the value.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Square’s CashTag service has a very simple and condensed credit card form that wraps everything into a linear process while keeping you on a single screen.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: It’s worth noting that Square isn’t the only company that’s adopted this type of interface. I noticed a similar credit card entry when I was setting up Lyft.</p>

<p>This credit card entry does a lot to keep you contextualized in the form and to indicate where you are in the process. It auto selects the type of card when you enter the first few digits (Note: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/72768/how-do-you-detect-credit-card-type-based-on-number">You should do this too</a>) It keeps the last 4 of the card available, which is typically used as an identifier. There are even small hints, like flipping the card image over when it gets to the CVV.</p>

<p>This feels like one of the first examples of forms that are designed specifically and contextually for mobile. The way that they’ve condensed this form lets you get a high-level overview in an extremely small space - and walks you through it in a linear fashion. I haven’t seen any testing to see if users can get through this easily (which makes me a little shy to endorse it), but it is a good example of <em>optimizing form experiences for small screens</em>.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: On each section of their settings page, Disqus provides microcopy that conveys the context for each section in a single sentence.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Microcopy serves as a bridge between me and a function. In each case here, it’s reasonably clear <em>what</em> each button does. The headlines give me an idea of what I can do in each section, which is important for scanning and general comprehension of the page.</p>

<p>What this microcopy does is more subtle: it gives me a <em>why</em> for each section. This can be impossibly difficult to do in a short headline. You need clarity and brevity so that the user can scan the page and find what they’re looking for. Consider the copy in the “Connected Accounts” section: “Connect your social media accounts for one-click login and to show off your online presence on your Disqus profile.” I now know what I will find in that section, and why it makes sense to enable the features.</p>

<p>Microcopy can’t make a bad interface good. When well-applied, though, it helps your user form a deeper understanding of your interface and your intentions.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When Waze finds a faster route, it tells you “There’s a better route” and automatically selects it after a short period.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: The language for this is great. “There’s a better way” feels so soothing and helpful when you’re stuck in traffic. I love that it also knows to select the faster route if you don’t interact with it. By contrast, Google Maps defaults to cancelling the new option, which is perplexing—obviously I want the fastest route possible!</p>

<p>What I particularly like about this design is how Waze displays the info specifically for glancing. Each fragment of information in this modal window is reinforced in multiple ways. The timer is both a number and a circle graph. The time saved is shown in a minutes saved and a new arrival time. When you are designing for consumption while someone is driving, getting the idea quickly is paramount.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: For contextual suggestion, this is obviously solid. If the user has recently taken a photo, it stands to reason that they might be coming to Instagram to post it.</p>

<p>What makes this suggestion particularly good is in its flexibility. There are more apps for photo taking and editing than I can possible think of. There are more avenues to share photos than are reasonable. Allowing users multiple ways to arrive at the desired behavior (and in a case like this, <em>prompting</em> the desired behavior) makes the application feel flexible and robust.</p>

        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: In a recent update of their user terms, Tumblr gives you a range of plain language options when you select “No”</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: There are few times that I feel more helpless as a user than when I’m looking at a EULA. I took a screenshot of the one that Apple popped up on my iPad recently, because it was <strong>56 pages</strong> I would have had to read. Not happening.</p>

<p>Most desktop software handles this rather petulantly by requiring you to agree before using the software, and quitting without warning if you decline. Facebook and Spotify recently had to deal with massive public outcry when they changed their service terms without overt notice. They expected that users read them (as if anyone has) and went ahead as if everyone tacitly agreed by using the service. Not a great way to earn user trust.</p>

<p>Tumblr’s way of getting that agreement feels far less draconian. It still sucks that I have to read 3 tab panes of endlessly scrolling content in a modal window(<em>Hint</em>: They don’t expect me to) but the casual lead in copy makes it feel less scary.</p>

<p>The best part is what happens when you decline. Instead of yelling at you and throwing the modal window back in your face, they actually give you options that consider what you would want <em>if you actually decline</em>. They give you options to end your relationship with them! They give you options to reach out for clarification! They clarify that you <em>actually need to accept if you are going to use the service</em>—but in human and gentle tone!</p>

<p>Unless you are designing for lawyers, (and honestly, even when you’re designing for lawyers) <em>don’t speak to your users like they’re lawyers</em>. Tumblr seems to get that.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Amazon recently released a dashboard that pops up on your account page with a bunch of high-level data.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As a retailer, Amazon’s diversity is one of its main selling points. As they begin subsuming more lines of business, they have created a problem for themselves on the account page. How can a single page encompass the enormity of your relationship with the company?</p>

<p>This dashboard highlights a step in the right direction. The majority of the information on it is directly relevant to me, and is stuff that I would frequently be looking for. The true success, though, is in the wonderful links under each snippet of data that tell me exactly how to interact with it. I’m most impressed with the “Subscribe and Save” where it indicates that an order is coming while selling it as savings, and yet still telling you when it will trigger. It breaks down a little bit in some areas, like the audiobook sell, but the intra-product advertising doesn’t feel heavy-handed here. It’s really that balance of information and action that makes it so successful.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: I’ve seen a few iterations of this form over time, and each time DigitalOcean redesigns it becomes clearer and more streamlined. It’s a wonderful example of iterative design.</p>

<p>There are obviously great decisions in how direct and simple the form is the form is: the order that it asks the questions in (Name, Size, Location, Software, Other Settings, Expert Stuff,) the great inline validation and the helpful microcopy.</p>

<p>What ties this form together so well for me is the fixed right sidebar. It functions as a mini navigation, tells you how long the form is, and what you selected for each option. It’s something that feels scalable too—an element that’s greatly flexible depending on form length and complexity.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When I ordered glasses last year, I called for some clarification. Someone picked up the phone after one ring.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Experience is grander than interface. Warby Parker’s site is nice. I didn’t have many problems ordering things. Their home try-on service was so amazing that it spawned a whole line of copycats.</p>

<p>However, their commitment to good customer service (or, if you will, customer experience) shows in the way that they structure their entire company. Having someone pick up the phone as soon as it rang shocked me so much that I was momentarily speechless. I had to apologize because I was in the middle of looking up my order email because I expected to be on hold.</p>

<p>When you are designing experiences, it isn’t enough to just take business decisions and turn them into interfaces. The interfaces will not fulfill every need, and then the user will fall back on those business decisions, for instance when they contact support. Consequently, we have to root all of our arguments in a user-centered philosophy to help us advocate for users through their <em>entire relationship</em> with our product.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com">The Lightning Design System</a> is the pattern library and styleguide for Salesforce.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: If you’ve been watching the design community, you may have noticed a huge focus on pattern libraries. The Lightning Design System made a big splash, and the <a href="https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/">US Web Design Standards</a> were greeted with intense fervor.</p>

<p>These design systems are so fantastic because they are moving us away from designing pages. The challenge with experience is that it’s not defined by a single point; it’s the <em>sum total of an entire relationship</em>. Designing individual views is too small, too limited in scope to shape a user’s <em>experience</em>.</p>

<p>Lightning Design System’s designers took time not just to document <em>what</em> the implementation looks like, but also to go into great detail to explain <em>how</em>. There are numerous types of documentation for each pattern: visual, code, and verbal. Each version of it explains what it is, how you get it, and why they did it this way. It’s broad and detailed, but without being so precise that it requires designers to implement every decision.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> is a Windows virtualization application for Macs. (It lets you run a Windows machine on your Mac, inception style.) The applications that Parallels virtualizes run on your dock alongside your regular applications.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Your users don’t care a single iota about your data model. Let me rephrase that, <em>unless they’re required</em> to interact with your data model, the users <em>shouldn’t have to care about it</em>.</p>

<p>Someone at Parallels asked the question “What is it you’re trying to do?” The answer is usually “I want to run a Windows application on my Mac.” Parallels is helping you bridge that gap by removing the first step—launching the virtualized machine. Your average user doesn’t want to think about the prerequisites for getting to their task. They don’t want to have to process: “I need to launch this other program before I can launch the program I want inside of it.”</p>

<p>Breaking down the technological barriers and allowing the user’s tasks to surface is an essential goal of UX design. Parallels removes the most confusing step from a complex task so the user only needs to think about their goal.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.primer&amp;hl=en">Primer</a> is a series of bite sized marketing lessons developed by Google. The content is presented as a stack of cards that are flipped through.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: We have a tendency to design for mobile as if it’s a laptop with an oddly-sized screen. It may just be symptomatic of how <em>new</em> mobile tech is, but it doesn’t fit how users approach their devices. We use mobile phones in short bursts, in busy environments, in the times between events. Designing for linear consumption just doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>Primer clearly designs their content for mobile consumption. Content is broken up into tiny chunks, like notecards for a speech that you can flip through. Each card has a pin on it, letting you pull out important nuggets to remember later. Pinned cards appear in their own section of the app, letting you see highlights from across multiple lessons. The lessons themselves are only a few minutes long, and each includes a progress bar, a few quizzes, and a few sections of cards.</p>

<p>As we begin adopting new mediums, which come with new methods of interaction and new abilities, it&rsquo;s lazy to assume we can keep creating and using content in the same way. Primer&rsquo;s content is written to be consumed in short bursts, and its design complements that. This exemplifies how we should think about the context in which users will interact with content on specific devices.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Google Fi sent me a package a few weeks after I signed up for their service. It thanked me for being an early customer, and included a set of headphones, an external battery, and a case for my phone.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Giving a gift <a href="https://goodui.org/#2">always goes over well</a>. What you give—and how you give it—matter a lot, though. Google Fi hit it out of the park here.</p>

<p>First, they didn’t tell me to expect anything. I didn’t receive a shipping notice; it just appeared on my doorstep on Monday. I was genuinely surprised. The language throughout the box is friendly and direct: “Hello again” as a greeting, “Thanks for being here from the beginning” as an explanation on the bottom of the lid, and cute labels on each item. The headphones are an odd design that allow you to plug in a secondary pair, and say “Turn airdrum solos into airdrum duets.” The battery pack and case say “100% all natural juice for your phone” and “Even phones need hugs.”</p>

        </div>
        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When Bucknell redesigned their site last year with the aid of the incomparable Fastspot, they went for a radical IA that allows multiple methods of navigation through the site content.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I am guilty of harping at people for wanting to do new things for the hell of it. Creating different things is great and fun, but you end up having to help the user along much more. Most people don&rsquo;t want to do that second step.</p>

<p>This IA condenses everything into a single massive, searchable directory. Complimenting this directory is a persona based navigation that uses natural language, helping you wayfind to something more useful if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking for. A &ldquo;Recent Pages&rdquo; section functions as a support element, letting you find things that are recent and giving you a soft bookmark for any relevant pages.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so hard to copy designs too - they live in an ecosystem. Without the persona navigation, the directory wouldn&rsquo;t serve the needs of users who aren&rsquo;t sure of their goals yet. Without powerful search tools, the everything directory is too hard to navigate. The persona nav is too limited in scope to handle everyone&rsquo;s needs. With a traditional hierarchical model, the history feature turns into more noise than content. Together though, these tools turn into a suite of navigation that feels different and so much smoother than navigating departments and majors to get simple information.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Tasty (and Buzzfeed cooking) use this style of video where it is filmed from overheard with ingredient overlays and ramping between important steps in the cooking process.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: These videos are largely designed to be shared through social media platforms, and it shows in the way that they are filmed. They are essentially unbranded (They have no celebrity associated with them), and are very simply focused on the steps required and the end result.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoy that the overhead camera shows you the entire process - but it also shows you the specific points that need attention. You get an idea on how much time it takes and how difficult it is because there are no cuts, just speed changes. You see how the ingredients change over time and what it needs to look like - but without any cruft or explanations.</p>

<p>Another nice touch is answering a question before it&rsquo;s asked. This particular recipe calls for a spice mix. After explaining the amount needed, the video cuts itself in half and shows you how to build the mix yourself (just in case you aren&rsquo;t the type to have a jar of Cajun Spices sitting about.) The visualization feels paranthetical, it <em>unpacks</em> an item and shows you how it&rsquo;s made without losing context in the greater recipe.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Trello strips away all of their homepage content to a single pair of CTAs. When you&rsquo;re logged in, it gives you the message &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re logged in! Go to your boards.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Designing websites that allow logins are a fundamentally different task than more static sites. Every time you make a content decision, you have to ask &ldquo;Is this right for both audiences?&rdquo;</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so clever about this is subtle. You&rsquo;ll notice that there&rsquo;s a difference between the URLs because Trello.com automatically redirects you to your boards when you&rsquo;re logged in. They know that you still might find your way to this homepage somehow, so they give you a simple and friendly way to get back. Thanks guys.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Tic TAG Toe is a tagging game from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seeyoucloud.readingstatspocket">Reading Stats in your Pocket</a>, a third party app that tells statistics about your Pocket Queue. It presents you five random items from your queue, and has you select tags for them.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: What sort of behavior do you want to <em>encourage</em> in your users? This app needs some polish, but the goal is brilliant. I have somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 items currently in my Pocket queue. The majority of them don&rsquo;t have tags. I&rsquo;ve spent time going through and tagging items in order, but it just feels like a drag. Bleh. No thanks.</p>

<p>This little feature is great because it&rsquo;s just 5 items! That will take just a minute, right? It escorts you 5 random untagged items in your queue, and suggests some tags or lets you pick your own. It then encourages you to go for another round. Even if the execution could be improved, the idea itself is a solid example of <em>managing complexity</em> for the user.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: This is a light dimmer that looks just like a normal light switch. Seems pretty mundane.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: This interface is so fantastic because it uses a familiar form factor and just adds in a new element. Let&rsquo;s pretend you don&rsquo;t know what a light dimmer is and you&rsquo;re afraid to experiment. You <em>still have the ability to use this like a normal light switch</em>.</p>

<p>Often when we are developing new interfaces, we want to make something completely bespoke and custom. However, it&rsquo;s so much better to reference the things that our users already know and understand. We don&rsquo;t have to be limited by what already exists, but <em>extending</em> the uses of existing interfaces (instead of doing a complete redesign) helps meet users where they are, whether they are experts or beginners.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I admit to a high level of skepticism when it comes health tracking apps and changing behavior. It&rsquo;s not fun to be shamed into walking more, so celebrating the successes are important.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t hit the goal all that frequently. The times that I do, it&rsquo;s worth some celebration! By contrast, I&rsquo;ve gotten an email every week from Moto Fit that begins with &ldquo;Everyone has an off week&rdquo; - mainly because I don&rsquo;t wear my watch on Saturdays or Sundays (so it thinks that I lie in bed all day or something.) The fanfare matches how I feel about it, so it&rsquo;s a great time to show a little flair.</p>

<p><strong>What it is</strong>: When selecting to hook up Jetpack to a hosted Wordpress installation, it gives a highly prioritized value sell. Three bullet points. Three!</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Jetpack offers <em>36 separate services</em> inside of it&rsquo;s umbrella. 36! That&rsquo;s an incredible amount! They are selling <strong>3</strong> of them.</p>

<p>Trading off and cutting down is always brutal, and the Jetpack team did their job fantastically. They cut down 36 separate items to the 6 most important. Then they hid half of those to give it the most punch. The ones that they kept, they prioritized the action verbs in each. Brilliant salesmanship (and it worked!)</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: In Facebook Messenger, when you are lame like me and don&rsquo;t have any group messages going, it gives you suggestions for starting one, such as &ldquo;For school friends?&rdquo; &ldquo;For a party?&rdquo; and &ldquo;For funny photos?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Every app has certain &ldquo;must include&rdquo; features that just make no sense to the average user. I think this might be one of those cases.</p>

<p>Facebook could have gone with the default and just made a single &ldquo;new group&rdquo; button, but the addition of this explanatory text is really what we&rsquo;re talking about here. These small bits of microcopy serve two roles, they tell me <em>how</em> I can use this feature (and what it&rsquo;s for) while also spurring the action.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Photo editing is pretty obviously not a new space. Anytime new software is introduce, its immediately compared to Photoshop and sometimes Pixelmator. I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy recalling the gruelling climb to become proficient in Photoshop. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to do it again.</p>

<p>The reason that these directions are so brilliant is because of their economy. They tell you how different click patterns will behave. They tell you how modifier keys will change the behavior. The microcopy is explanatory, but short.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Nobody likes being told &ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;re in the wrong part of the app.&rdquo; This flow is particularly effective because it accomodates a user&rsquo;s thought process - instead of giving an empty state &ldquo;nothing matched your search&rdquo; it takes the data of your search and uses it constructively. It turns a &ldquo;no&rdquo; into a &ldquo;yes, and&rdquo; so I don&rsquo;t have to jump over into the projects section to enter in the new thing I&rsquo;m working on.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I haven&rsquo;t dealt with a lot of good android wear apps yet. Media players and Hangouts aside, most of the functionality has been bizzare and useless.</p>

<p>This app is good because it doesn&rsquo;t try too hard. It&rsquo;s very simple functionally and it doesn&rsquo;t try to force me into any awkward interfaces. (everything is a non local tap or a big swipe) Above all, the value of it makes total sense to me. Have 30 seconds? Review some flash cards!</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Prune is an an atmospheric and haunting game about growing your tree to reach light. The animations are used instead of instructions to indicate to the user how to navigate.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Believe it or not, I had never considered how I would move back and forth between the categories of levels before making this gif. The animation as you change worlds led me to think I could probably just pan back and forth, and behold, I can!</p>

<p>Prune has a remarkable economy of text, (they don&rsquo;t want to violate the spare environment) so it is a wonderful example of visual explanation. Each state that you can arrive to has an entrance and an exit animation that orients you to where you are and what is available to you.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: This sort of tiny detail is so helpful in our cross device and attention starved world. Vimeo&rsquo;s time badge is easy to miss, especially on mobile. WordsU calling it out on the title slide ensures that I&rsquo;ll know it isn&rsquo;t a 5 minute tutorial, so I can punch in and out quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Ommwriter&rsquo;s environment is carefully considered. It doesn&rsquo;t allow you to use multiple windows. It shuts down your secondary monitor. It plays a series of serene, instrumental songs. It has no text formatting. It gives you 3 font options.</p>

<p>It strips away distractions and forces you to focus on the work at hand. Its lack of compromise is what makes it useful, I <strong>could</strong> use so many other programs for the same concept. When the going gets tough though, nothing shuts out the clutter as well.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When translating Japanese text, Google Translate has you take a picture of it and then highlight the text with a finger.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I have always communicated with a roman alphabet. I have no idea how to get a Japanese keyboard, or how to use it once I had it. How then do I enter in my Japanese characters for translation?</p>

<p>Enter Google Translate. I have literally no idea how I would have bridged this gap without this functionality. I don&rsquo;t exactly know what purpose the highlighting holds, but as soon as you start working with it, it&rsquo;s incredibly clear.</p>

<p>Side Note on Translation Quality: Yes, it&rsquo;s not great. I used it to translate the instructions for a Japanese Water Stone I bought off of Amazon, and while broken and bizarre, I understood it well enough to have a santoku knife that I can now shave with. Brilliant!</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Every Monday, Spotify gives me 30 songs in a playlist based off of things that it thinks I&rsquo;ll like.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Do you remember the magical, early days of Pandora? The simple idea that you could listen to a radio station based off of a song or artist you enjoyed was revolutionary. It had its flaws though, the most crucial of which I wryly nicknamed “Pandora Decay,” where your favorite station, if left untended, would slowly wander away from its intended seed until you didn’t even recognize its starting point anymore. You could manage it with carefully tending the stream, thumbsing up and down songs and moving them to different stations, but in the end that was just more work. I wasn’t looking for something to tend, I just wanted music that I like.</p>

<p>Discover Weekly is a different idea in a similar space. Spotify sees what you listen to, so it reaches across the breadth of your taste from your listening and picks songs that it thinks that you’ll like. It averages about a 50% hit rate for me; Half the time I enjoy the song and save it. (as you can see in the screenshot) By comparison, Spotify’s radio function gets about 30%, even with careful curation.</p>

<p>The beauty of this is in its unassuming nature. The songs are just there, not a radio station I’m not allowed to browse through, but a playlist—a mixtape from a friend. <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2015/07/22/discovering-spotifys-discover-weekly/">I’m not the only one to feel this way about it</a>. Injecting it into the existing feature, playlists, gets me more intwined with a powerful feature, playlists are meant to be shared. They’re the new mixtape! Not only that, but as I learn that Spotify will literally <em>find</em> me music without me asking, it reenforces their value proposition. I don’t just want to keep paying for Spotify so I can listen to Bell Biv Devoe 15 times in a row, I also now am counting on it noticing and giving me some other early 90’s hip hop.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Treehouse is designed to keep you just outside of your comfort zone, so they do a lot to help ease the pain. There are small rewards, good ways of indicating your progress, and constant contextualization.</p>

<p>This little navigation appears inside of a module, a collection of lessons, code challenges, and quizzes that are like a course. The navigation has a ton of information packed into a tiny space with titles, content types, and location all wrapped together. I particularly like the use of the profile picture as the location marker - it&rsquo;s instantly recognizable and helps reinforce that I&rsquo;m making progress (Even in PHP)</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Skitch is generally a great excercise in doing something fast and getting out of the way. Its toolset is limited, and everything revolves around quickly grabbing something, annotating it, and getting it into your file system.</p>

<p>Skitch understands its own context, you typically boot it up in the <em>middle</em> of a task flow. Instead of requiring you to drive through a standard save dialog, Skitch gets that you&rsquo;re probably already looking at what you want and where you want to put it, so it gives you the fastest way possible to accomplish that.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you are traveling and getting stuck in traffic, Google Maps now tease apart the time added by the traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: When we were driving back from Cedar Point a few weeks ago, we noticed that our &ldquo;time to home&rdquo; kept spiking up. Normally we would just be consigned to sit in traffic, but the tools that Google now offers through maps gave us all of the information we needed to make decisions. While we could just trust that the suggested route is faster, the little badge helps prove the point, and makes the user feel like they have control over the situation.</p>

<p>These little badges have also been really helpful at helping contextualize the traffic that I deal with on a daily commute. Instead of just knowing &ldquo;The traffic is bad,&rdquo; Google now quantifies how bad the traffic is, enabling me to make the best decisions possible.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When working in Confluence, there are a number of shortcuts available to you at any given time. Confluence indicates these shortcuts with subtle hints, like underlining a single letter or including it in parenthesis in a tooltip.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Keyboard shortcuts are the consummate expert&rsquo;s tool. For any application, there&rsquo;s inevitably a cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts somewhere that indicates everything you can do with them. I even have an index card on my desk with a list of shortcuts for Trello while I&rsquo;m learning them.</p>

<p>Confluence isn&rsquo;t a tool that most people live in, so expecting the user to memorize all of keyboard shortcuts isn&rsquo;t realistic. This subtle indication doesn&rsquo;t get in the way, but it does tell me what things I can do quickly. Incidentally, I&rsquo;ve learned the keyboard shortcuts incredibly quickly because they&rsquo;re always present.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Slack somewhat recently announced their emoji response system, a great way to cut down on superfluous messages. When you respond to a message with just an emoji, slackbot tells you about the new feature.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Telling users about new features can be difficult. Release notes aren&rsquo;t very interesting, so most of the time people don&rsquo;t pay a lot of attention to them.</p>

<p>Instead of beating you over the head with the idea, (or expecting you to find it in the release notes) slackbot gives you a quick message that tells you how to use the feature. It only shows up for the first few times you use it (I had to go find an old, unused Slack because it wouldn&rsquo;t come up in any of the ones I use on a regular basis) and it only shows up when you respond with just an emoji. The subtle details matter here too, slackbot indicates that the message is only visible to the user through a color shift and short disclaimer.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Envato is a company all about creative community commerce on the web. That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re going to be talking about here though, their website is so insanely fast that it&rsquo;s worth talking about.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The first time I clicked a link on this site, I honestly thought something went wrong. The entire page changed so quickly, could it have possibly loaded a new page that fast? I included a clock on this gif so that you could see how quickly this thing loads. I was in an incognito window too, so this is without caching.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become so used to websites loading slowly (even over broadband) that a multimedia site loading in under a second shocked me. Performance is such an integral part of experience, but we expect it to be a piece that&rsquo;s layered on at the end—a task that the engineers check off right before launch. Keeping performance on the table as a constant consideration is vital to building products that can deliver on user expectations for speed.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: The mindmapping tool <a href="https://www.xmind.net/">XMind</a> creates its data set in such a way that you can copy and paste data between it and a spreadsheet, like excel.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is good</strong>: I know I&rsquo;m running the risk of sounding like I&rsquo;m just trying to sell this product, but hear me out. For about 2 years, I tried to find something that would just create a flow diagram from an excel file. I even tried building it on my own in Axure at one point. (with hilariously limited success)</p>

<p>Everything that I found was incredibly rigid. There were some things that showed promise, like <a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_yed_helpresources.html">yED</a> or <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com">LucidChart</a>, but in each case, I had to format my excel file in some arcane fashion. I did it in LucidChart at one point for a large navigation, and it took me about 3 hours. It sucked.</p>

<p>When I discovered that this product just let me work with my data <em>in my own mental model</em>, I was so excited I almost cried. I danced around for an entire afternoon. I copied it back and forth repeatedly just to watch it happen. Allow me to remind you, this is for a program that draws a chart.</p>

<p>When I read posts like <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3042849/delightful-interaction-design-needs-to-die">this one &ldquo;Delightful Interaction Design Needs to Die&rdquo;</a>, I&rsquo;m reluctantly in agreement. True delight doesn&rsquo;t come from a widget animating unexpectedly, that only provokes surprise. Delight comes from a something fitting into my needs, snapping into my mental model, and extending my ability to pursue my goals.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Google Fi is Google&rsquo;s phone carrier. It&rsquo;s a combination of leased traffic from Sprint and T-Mobile, and a lot of verified Wi Fi networks. The explainations on their website use simple language and animations to help convey the fairly complex techologies that make it work.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: This is a master class in explaining complex, technological concepts to inexperienced users. How do you go about explaining wifi switching? Multi network use? VPN tunneling? This site brushes all of these concepts, and explains them in a way that either lays out the concept clearly, or explains it generally to the point that the user needs to understand.</p>

<p>Take for instance the section on data encryption. They know that most people have heard to be careful of sending data over unencrypted networks, so is auto wifi connecting safe? Here&rsquo;s how they explain it: &ldquo;<em>Your data is secured through encryption when we connect you to open Wi-Fi hotspots. It&rsquo;s like your data has a private tunnel to drive through.</em>&rdquo; Two sentences, a lot left unsaid, but enough that I understand why it&rsquo;s not a concern.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Most of the cards you get in Hearthstone come in these packs of 5. You can purchase them directly, or get them as rewards.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Whenever you are creating a system based off of microtransactions, there&rsquo;s always the question of &ldquo;What is the user buying?&rdquo; Whenever I&rsquo;ve played a game that requires me to pay just to play it, I respond colorfully and delete it. (I&rsquo;m looking at you Clash of Clans)</p>

<p>Hearthstone is a card game, so how do you make a <em>digital</em> card that has worth? By wrapping the card acquisition in a little fanfare, Hearthstone adds a level of anticipation and reverence to each pack. Not only that, the pack bursting apart and each card flipping as you click it reinforces Hearthstone&rsquo;s physical interface.</p>

<p>The blue aura that you see around the last card I open indicates it&rsquo;s of higher rarity, and the game&rsquo;s narrator (The Innkeeper) exclaims &ldquo;Rare!&rdquo; when I reveal it. It does this with any card that isn&rsquo;t a common card, so it is guaranteed once a pack. The anticipation is small, but as an avid player of the game, my heart rate skyrockets when I hover on a card with an orange glow. (Which is the rarest type, legendary) It&rsquo;s one of those hooks that doesn&rsquo;t lose its magic when you see behind the curtain.</p>

<p>If you want more information on Hearthstone&rsquo;s physical interface (Inculuding the pack opening), I highly recommend this amazing <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022036/Hearthstone-How-to-Create-an">presentation by one of its designers, Derek Sakamoto</a>.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Sunrise is a calendar app that acts as an intermediary between all of your other calendars. I started using it because it would pull my due dates from Trello, but I&rsquo;ve also found that it integrates with just about every calendar service.</p>

<p>This is how you create an event in Sunrise, and some of the options available to you.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Two words—consolidation and suggestion. First, every conceivable option that you can apply to this event is rolled into one densely packed interface. It is dense, but the flow makes complete sense because it feels like a list of questions, and that list matches how I think about my events:</p>

<ul><li><em>What am I doing?</em></li>
<li><em>When?</em></li>
<li><em>Where?</em></li>
<li><em>Who?</em></li>
<li><em>Anything Else?</em></li>
</ul><p>It rolls in smart suggestions, like having an incredibly fast and accurate calendar lookup, pulling in my address book for invitations, and even subtle things like changing the icon based on what the event is called.</p>

<p>My favorite piece of it though is that <em>Sunrise allows you to create an event without asking you which calendar it&rsquo;s on</em>. This is incredibly important to an aggregation tool like this - I don&rsquo;t want to think about <em>how</em> I have to create the event, I just want to create it. While the interface could be better, making the calendar the last choice before you save instead of the first choice (Like Outlook for instance) removes so much mental friction from the process, and allows me to focus on the more relevant details.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="http://codepen.seesparkbox.com/">A remarkably in depth, nuanced (formerly) real time case study</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Really? Do you need an explanation of this? Let me finish hyperventilating and I&rsquo;ll try.</p>

<p>First: Why do case studies exist? To get you work, right? This case study transcends that idea entirely. This will probably get Sparkbox work, but it is a tremendous gift to the design community. I&rsquo;ve watched the process play out as they release new content, delighted by the nuance and watching them discuss about the places where the process works and where it doesn&rsquo;t. The case study is specific to CodePen, and broad in thinking about how we design modern products. It is a real time, multimedia thesis.</p>

<p>Second: I guarantee that if you are a designer, you looked up Sparkbox and considered a move to the midwest after looking at this case study. It gives you such a powerful sense of who they are as a company, how they work, and what motivates them.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even know what else to say. Just&hellip; Go read it.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you make a purchase at Starbucks with their app, it gives you the ability to tip your baristas for a few hours afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: When Starbucks first released the ability to pay with an app, I jumped at the opportunity. One less &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; card to carry and a constantly refreshing bucket of coffee dollars. Tipping is really important to me, so I had a pretty constant annoyance that I would have to carry cash in to tip the baristas. What&rsquo;s the point of a digital system if I still have to bring cash?</p>

<p>About a year ago, I gained the ability to apply a tip after a transaction happens, and the window stays open and adjustable for a few hours. The brilliance comes in a few forms, the preset amounts so it&rsquo;s literally 1 tap to select an amount, the notification that indicates that the purchase has gone through (I don&rsquo;t mind the prompt, it helps me to remember), and the transaction history that updates as you select the different amounts. The major selling point for me though is that it gives you the ability to select these amounts in the notification, which means I can give the baristas a dollar with my smartwatch.</p>

<p>Welcome to the future.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: For a project like this that aims at a single post a day, scheduling posts is a grand idea. The queue is an even better idea however, a list of posts that are automatically published every day at the same time.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Neutrogena Naturals Face wash switches up how it handles the ingredients list, showing where the different elements come from.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The average consumer has an odd relationship with the word &ldquo;chemical.&rdquo; We use the term as a stand in for a whole host of other bad terms; toxin, carcinogen, caustic, solvent, cleaner, the list goes on. Chemical names are just as scary, we don&rsquo;t understand them so we assume it&rsquo;s bad.</p>

<p>With the natural push in many products, manufacturers have an added difficulty of conveying <em>what the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; element of their product is</em>. If I&rsquo;m uninformed as a consumer, do I have any idea what &ldquo;Cocamidopropyl Betaine&rdquo; means? Definitely not, that sounds scary.</p>

<p>By listing where the ingredients come from, Neutrogena gives credibility to its claim. Instead of just seeing a lot of words that I don&rsquo;t understand, I can see that it comes from a coconut. It&rsquo;s a move that facilitates confidence, and helps me feel like they aren&rsquo;t making baseless claims.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When listening to Spotify&rsquo;s radio, the thumbs up icon tells you that it&rsquo;s improving the station before adding it to a playlist for you.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: First, the pause is brilliant. I&rsquo;m sure Spotify doesn&rsquo;t need any processing time to pick the next song, but this brief pause makes me feel like they&rsquo;re actually doing something important. The reason that it works to make me wait for a second is that it&rsquo;s <em>unlikely at this point</em> that I would want to do something else, so the action doesn&rsquo;t block me.</p>

<p>The part that elevates this to an amazing design is automatically adding it to a playlist. Liking a song to improve a station is a concept that I&rsquo;m used to because of Pandora. Adding it to a list where I can find it later (and play it by itself) is a direct sell of Spotify&rsquo;s added value - You can listen to it on the radio, but you <em>can also listen to it by itself</em>. Even though it&rsquo;s subtle, this interface piece underscores that value proposition.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When travelling home from Philadelphia this past weekend, I brought up Google Now. It showed me a list of gas stations off of my route, and the amount of time the detour would take.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: It&rsquo;s been fascinating to watch Google make changes to Now as it&rsquo;s evolved as a product. When Now first started, it only had the ability to tell you things that were near to you. Useful, sure, but not so much when you&rsquo;re speeding down an interstate.</p>

<p>This use case is an exact compliment to my needs, it was exactly what my wife and I needed as we travelled down the interstate. The biggest challenge is I don&rsquo;t know how to <em>make it appear</em>, but Google guessed correctly and made it surface at the right time.</p>

<p>Now I just need it to do the same thing for coffee shops</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Starbucks recently released a line of tumblers in which you can customize the case. The labels on these use alternating color and blind deboss to indicate they are parts of a set.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: It&rsquo;s hard to indicate to users when they need to pay attention. In software, we have a lot of ways to handle this by locking down the system until certain requirements have been fulfilled. We don&rsquo;t always have that option though.</p>

<p>This little set is more subtle than slapping big numbers on the tumbler and case, but it provides the same effect. The blind deboss is different, it catches attention enough that you realize that there&rsquo;s another level of information. Put next to each other, the relationship is clear instantly.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: 500px is a photo sharing and discovery site. Their <a href="https://500px.com/terms">terms and conditions</a> are a 2 column page, the left column is all the legal-ese required to run a large site, and they then explain it on the right.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: EULA&rsquo;s and legal text in general are terrible experiences. If each interpersonal relationship began with a 10 minute recitation of what you were agreeing to by entering into this relationship, being a hermit would be much more socially acceptable.</p>

<p>Some products decide to address this by shaming the user into reading the EULA that they&rsquo;ve agreed to sight unseen. While it makes a product developer feel better, it doesn&rsquo;t really encourage anyone to enter the situation with more knowledge. 500px takes a different route, it gets that you <strong>want</strong> to understand what you&rsquo;re agreeing to, and then gives you the ability to bridge that gap.</p>

<p>The brilliant part of this design is in the juxtaposition. Instead of just writing a long document and then a simplified version, laying it side by side makes me feel as a user that this is an accurate translation. The large copy and short sentences make it easy to scan and understand. It gives me a quicker way to get the same information, which is brilliant.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="entry__text">
          <p><em>Note</em>: This is based on an earlier version of the Bellroy website which you can see at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140209075825/http://bellroy.com/wallets/slim-sleeve-wallet">archive.org</a></p>

<p><strong>What is is</strong>: Bellroy is a steadily growing line of &ldquo;every day carry&rdquo; items. They began with wallets, which is still the majority of their product line. When they just sold wallets, they arranged their products on a continuum of features, going from &ldquo;Slimmest&rdquo; to &ldquo;Most features.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Product lines can be difficult to explain well to an end user. How do you go about showing the difference between the products and helping the user identify the right solution for their needs?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve come back to this particular idea so many times because of how breathtakingly <em>clear</em> it was to me when I was purchasing a wallet from this company. I instantly knew what tradeoffs I was making, and felt like I had a good sense of accomodating my needs. The categorization above the wallets functioned as a breakpoint, helping me determine where exactly my needs lay.</p>

<p>The secondary effect was helping me &ldquo;fuzzy find&rdquo; what I wanted. While I wasn&rsquo;t sure exactly which wallet was right for me, having them displayed in a range like this helped me determine <em>what I didn&rsquo;t need</em> right off the bat. I spent very little time looking above the &ldquo;Hide and Seek&rdquo; or below the &ldquo;Slim Sleeve&rdquo; because the range defined where my dividing line was for features that I wanted or needed.</p>

<p>While I was sad to see them iterate away from it, it&rsquo;s great to see that they didn&rsquo;t let a great idea hinder the growth of their product line. Clinging to this narrative wouldn&rsquo;t have made sense when they added phone cases or a more rugged line (The features are different, not just more)</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When walking around Philadelphia, there are a number of signs to help orient tourists like me. These signs change based on which direction you&rsquo;re walking on the street.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: One of the best things about good UX (and in my opinion, one of the things that makes it hardest to talk about) is that the truly best pieces of it are so obvious that they don&rsquo;t seem worth talking about. When I pointed out these signs to my wife (and pointedly took photos of it,) her comment was &ldquo;Well of course, how else would you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reasons that these signs make so much sense is that they understand their integration with the environment. Not only do they orient you based on the direction you&rsquo;re walking, they also highlight things that are close and along the route you are walking. Some smaller signs mounted high on lamps take this a step further, recentering the map on you and only showing you the things in front of you.</p>

<p>In all, it&rsquo;s a tremendously simple effect that has great utility.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When browsing listings on Yelp, there&rsquo;s a small map that gives you the location of your different establishments. You can expand the map with a link titled &ldquo;Mo&rsquo; Map&rdquo; that pops the map open.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The importance of a map can&rsquo;t be overstated when looking for something close (in my case, to a hotel). The way that Yelp has handled this walks a delightfully fine line. The playful language makes it feel inconsequential, you aren&rsquo;t changing your query, just modifying it.</p>

<p>My favorite piece though can be easy to miss, the listings also strip down their complexity when the map is larger. This is done very intentionally to keep the listings approximately the same height, which keeps you at about the same place in the listings if you&rsquo;ve been browsing them.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When selecting items in Google Drive, a small toolbar pops up that allows you to star the item, pin it (Which saves it to the device,) share it, or a host of other functions that can be popped up from the side menu.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Google Drive takes a big risk in the layout of its various files. Because it uses a tile based approach, many of the features that users have come to expect aren&rsquo;t as readily available in options on the tiles themselves.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to wedge a bunch of icons on the tile itself or taking you to a different screen (Where you wouldn&rsquo;t have any mass editing options,) this toolbar accurately balances multiple use cases. While it is unfortunate that these icons don&rsquo;t tell you what they do, the compromise of granular single file activities and mass editing is brilliant.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: USAA recently released an Android Wear update to their app, which lets you see account balance on your watch. The PIN entry system has a large keyboard, and a ring lights up around the watchface to indicate how many digits you&rsquo;ve entered.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Interactions on wearable screens are tough because of real estate. The tiny screen and low resolution leaves it difficult to communicate, and the interfaces are highly gestural to combat this.</p>

<p>This interface is a great example of maximizing real-estate and making the experience as painless as possible. The glowing ring is quickly apparent, and shows error state when the pin is incorrect.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Paper is an application for sketching and diagramming. It uses an extended metaphore of pages and books to navigate and display drawings.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Tablets are fundamentally different devices than computers. Our input methods, where we use them (usually), our method of engagement, and our emotional state are all different. Consequentially, some of the decades of baggage from designing mouse and keyboard interfaces doesn&rsquo;t hold up well in touch.</p>

<p>Paper does a wonderful job at relating itself to a different metaphor, books. It brings physicality to this interface to help orient users, and does some pretty heavy handholding when you first begin with it. The little gif above shows how you can move shapes around like a post-it note (including whatever&rsquo;s drawn on it), and then how pinching motions bring you out of page view and then out of book view. Part of the reason this gestural interface is so successful is because of the requirements of a drawing surface - You don&rsquo;t want an interface, you want a canvas.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When setting up a new Trello board, you can set a background for it. There&rsquo;s also a little die that lets you randomize the board background.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Trello walks a fine line as a brand. On the one hand, they&rsquo;re playful, silly, and earnest. Their mascot is a Husky named Taco. C'mon. On the other hand, their service is used for everything from home organization (which fits the brand well) to critical business processes (in which the brand could feel pointless and frivolous.) Consequentially, they take a light touch with the sillyness in the actual interface.</p>

<p>Here though, the board backround really isn&rsquo;t that consequential, and they get that. The randomization function is handled quietly and simply, and with a little zest of fun. It&rsquo;s a great example of an easter egg that <strong>enhances</strong> functionality without hindering expert workflows.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The books that Rosenfeld publishes walk a fine line between reference manual and professional development. These chapter leadins are so successful because they so accurately consider <strong>why</strong> the consumer is reading this book. The full color spread makes it easy to find these pages as you flip through the book. Detailed headings give an overview of the chapter contents, as well as their locations. My favorite bit is the line graph though, which gives you an example of the relative length of this chapter to the entire book. It&rsquo;s similar to a Kindle saying &ldquo;3 hours left in this book,&rdquo; but more subtle and beautiful.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Toggl is a simple, web based, time tracking app. They make a browser extension that places a small button in a variety of different web apps like Trello, Jira, and Gmail. Clicking the button pulls the relevant text from whatever the button is near, and starts a time entry for it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: There are <strong>so</strong> many products available. There have been a wave of recent businesses that have made product integrations a central part of their strategy, like Slack or Stripe. Toggl has API integration as well, but it also has this lighter weight browser extension.</p>

<p>The beauty of this extension is that it doesn&rsquo;t overcomplicate the idea behind timetracking. It gets that you are just trying to start an entry, lets you pick a few options, and then gets out of the way. It also tracks state in both the button and on the favicon, showing me that everything worked correctly. It&rsquo;s quiet but efficient.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: YNAB is a budgeting app (Short for You Need a Budget (You probably do)). It is a powerful example of a UI being shaped by underlying philosophy. Back to the point - When you are entering income, if you indicate something is income and then enter the dollars in as an outflow, it stops you with a modal window.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Modal windows are awful. This is especially true in an interface like this, where I&rsquo;m using all keyboard entry and have to find my mouse.</p>

<p>This modal is necessary though, and it is a gold standard for best practices. It appears at a reasonable time, after I&rsquo;ve finished typing and hit enter or clicked save. It has very short, scannable copy that includes bold text to help me figure out the issue. It uses semantically accurate copy on the buttons, indicating what each does. It even has a somewhat self deprecating header &ldquo;Hey user, I&rsquo;m being rude, just let me check this really quick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is rude, but it&rsquo;s saved me more than one headache as I speed through entering transactions and so I&rsquo;m grateful for it.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: In the dressing room at Marshalls (A discount clothing retailer) the hooks on the walls for hangers are labeled with small signs reading &ldquo;Definitely,&rdquo; &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tomorrow&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: Trying on clothes is not an incredibly fun experience, so anything that makes me more comfortable is welcome.  In one corner, &ldquo;Definitely&rdquo; and &ldquo;Possibly&rdquo; are right next to each other, allowing for quick comparisons. &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; while not being incredibly well labelled, is across the room, giving some separation. With a few simple signs (and some great natural feeling light), Marshalls subtlety directs the entire experience.</p>

          <p><strong>What is is</strong>: Pocket is an app that helps you keep track of things you want to read. On iOS, when you open the app while you have a URL on your clipboard, Pocket asks if you would like to save it.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: One of the more frustrating behaviors on iOS is the limited way that apps are allowed to talk to each other. If your data cannot be pushed through the native share functionality, there&rsquo;s no way to get information between apps, right?</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s so lovely about this small, unobtrusive interaction is that Pocket realizes that you cannot always share a url that you want to save, sometimes it comes up in a weird place that doesn&rsquo;t allow you that flexibility. This little interaction doesn&rsquo;t get in your way, but it does realize that if you have a URL that you&rsquo;ve copied, you probably want to do something with it.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Kickstarter newsletter sign up in the footer of their site. Clicking the scissors three times causes the footer to fall off and the sign up form to appear in its place.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I have a special dislike for mailing list signups, largely because so many sites seem to bludgeon me over the head with them. Kickstarter&rsquo;s newsletter signup sets a completely different tone for what they&rsquo;re accomplishing, you aren&rsquo;t just opting to recieve emails, you&rsquo;re <em>joining the club</em>.</p>

<p>This is a true example of delightful design; The designers didn&rsquo;t just craft a goofy animation, it&rsquo;s a genuinely suprising effect. It is a perfect support to Kickstarter&rsquo;s playful, small company image, quite a feat considering their size and revenue.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: A mobile robot, about 5'7&quot; tall and remotely controlled. The user has an interface that allows them to drive the robot around and it has 2 way voice and visual communication.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The woman pictured here is <a href="https://twitter.com/KavitaKrish21">Kavita Krishnaswami</a> - a PHD student in Computer Science at UMBC. Kavita&rsquo;s physical disabilities render her bedridden, so she attends conferences and gives talks with the Beam Telepresence.</p>

<p>I met her this past Wednesday at her presentation on robotics and disability. She came up to me, we introduced ourselves, spoke for a bit, and then broke off the conversation naturally. I had a thrill when I realized the <em>agency</em> that this machine provided her that cannot be matched by a Skype call, or even a wheelchair.</p>

<p>The makers of this product have put a lot of time into making it feel <em>natural</em> and considering who will use it and how. The height of the screen and camera are at about average eye level. The robot is quick, but not so much so that it&rsquo;s unstable or disconcerting. There are small details too, like lights illuminating the support pillars, making it so the robot isn&rsquo;t just a floating screen in dark environments.</p>

<p>At one point in her presentation, Kavita described the first time using a beam, saying &ldquo;It was the first time I had ever stood.&rdquo; This product is clearly informed by a deep understanding of the motivations and needs of its users, and that is instantly apparent when you see it in use.</p>

          <p><strong>What it is</strong>: This is the second step after I create my account, after skipping the &ldquo;follow these blogs&rdquo; step. Suggested content appears all around, but this is clearly the center of the interface.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The animation is subtle, but friendly. It draws me to the center of the screen, uses casual and accessible language, and indicates interactivity. The dashed lines act as a wireframe to indicate how content will come in if I follow blogs, avatar and posts. There are also more subtle things going on, like introducing you to the unique icon that Tumblr uses for &ldquo;Link.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This ends up for a great launch point to start my blog. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like a huge deal, it feels natural, easy, and directed.</p>

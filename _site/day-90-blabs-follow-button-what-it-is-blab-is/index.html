        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Blab is a livestreaming conversation platform that is closely integrated with Twitter. The members who are streaming have a small button on them that lets you follow them on Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: Many new social products, like Meerkat or Product Hunt, are built heavily on top of existing social networks—usually Twitter. With these tight integrations comes a blurring of the lines between the two networks. They each become part of a unified experience that directly feeds into eachother.</p>

<p>Blab could have made a network of their own where you signed up for an account and followed people through their service (like Twitch for instance,) but instead they focused on the goal of their application—a live video multistream. The tight integration supports their goal, and so it lets them play to their strengths. They didn’t reinvent the wheel, but found a way to extend a successful product.</p>

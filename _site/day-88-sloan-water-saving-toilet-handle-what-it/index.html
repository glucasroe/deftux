        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Sloan water saving handles are green, and have a label that indicate which direction you should push the handle to use the water saving function.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: This one feels a little out there, but bear with me. When things look the same, we don’t pay attention to them. They fade into the background and we use them automatically.</p>

<p>Usually, these water saving toilets use a circle cut in two halves. I have no idea what they mean, and I just guess at which of the two buttons to push. I’m wrong a lot.</p>

<p>In this case though, they use the interface I know. The combination of the color shift and the label immediately indicated that this should be used differently. The unifying element is the smart default though, when you pull the handle <em>towards you</em> starts a water saving flush. It’s a safe bet, and definitely the behavior that both the designer (and the store owner) want to encourage.</p>

        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When Bucknell redesigned their site last year with the aid of the incomparable Fastspot, they went for a radical IA that allows multiple methods of navigation through the site content.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: I am guilty of harping at people for wanting to do new things for the hell of it. Creating different things is great and fun, but you end up having to help the user along much more. Most people don&rsquo;t want to do that second step.</p>

<p>This IA condenses everything into a single massive, searchable directory. Complimenting this directory is a persona based navigation that uses natural language, helping you wayfind to something more useful if you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re looking for. A &ldquo;Recent Pages&rdquo; section functions as a support element, letting you find things that are recent and giving you a soft bookmark for any relevant pages.</p>

<p>This is why it&rsquo;s so hard to copy designs too - they live in an ecosystem. Without the persona navigation, the directory wouldn&rsquo;t serve the needs of users who aren&rsquo;t sure of their goals yet. Without powerful search tools, the everything directory is too hard to navigate. The persona nav is too limited in scope to handle everyone&rsquo;s needs. With a traditional hierarchical model, the history feature turns into more noise than content. Together though, these tools turn into a suite of navigation that feels different and so much smoother than navigating departments and majors to get simple information.</p>

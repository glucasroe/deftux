<p><strong>What it is</strong>: A mobile robot, about 5'7&quot; tall and remotely controlled. The user has an interface that allows them to drive the robot around and it has 2 way voice and visual communication.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The woman pictured here is <a href="https://twitter.com/KavitaKrish21">Kavita Krishnaswami</a> - a PHD student in Computer Science at UMBC. Kavita&rsquo;s physical disabilities render her bedridden, so she attends conferences and gives talks with the Beam Telepresence.</p>

<p>I met her this past Wednesday at her presentation on robotics and disability. She came up to me, we introduced ourselves, spoke for a bit, and then broke off the conversation naturally. I had a thrill when I realized the <em>agency</em> that this machine provided her that cannot be matched by a Skype call, or even a wheelchair.</p>

<p>The makers of this product have put a lot of time into making it feel <em>natural</em> and considering who will use it and how. The height of the screen and camera are at about average eye level. The robot is quick, but not so much so that it&rsquo;s unstable or disconcerting. There are small details too, like lights illuminating the support pillars, making it so the robot isn&rsquo;t just a floating screen in dark environments.</p>

<p>At one point in her presentation, Kavita described the first time using a beam, saying &ldquo;It was the first time I had ever stood.&rdquo; This product is clearly informed by a deep understanding of the motivations and needs of its users, and that is instantly apparent when you see it in use.</p>

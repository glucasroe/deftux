        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> sells virtual machines that they call “droplets.” Their Droplet setup process is simple, streamlined, and easy to move through.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: I’ve seen a few iterations of this form over time, and each time DigitalOcean redesigns it becomes clearer and more streamlined. It’s a wonderful example of iterative design.</p>

<p>There are obviously great decisions in how direct and simple the form is the form is: the order that it asks the questions in (Name, Size, Location, Software, Other Settings, Expert Stuff,) the great inline validation and the helpful microcopy.</p>

<p>What ties this form together so well for me is the fixed right sidebar. It functions as a mini navigation, tells you how long the form is, and what you selected for each option. It’s something that feels scalable too—an element that’s greatly flexible depending on form length and complexity.</p>

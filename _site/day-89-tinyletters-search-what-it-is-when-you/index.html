        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When you navigate between different areas of Tinyletter’s web application, the search bar changes to indicate what it would be searching.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: As a user, it can be really difficult to understand the scope of your possibilities. I saw this a lot when working in an agency, in the form of social networking icons. On different sites, these icons could serve a number of different purposes; sharing the page they were on, sharing the site in general, or even navigating to the company’s social properties.</p>

<p>Search can fall into the same trap, sometimes a search is for an entire site and other times it is on for the page that you’re on. In this case, the search being a part of the header makes it fit with Tinyletter’s minimalist design, but it <em>feels</em> like it might be a full site (or in this case, application) search.</p>

<p>With a simple addition of text, it not only reinforces where you are, but it tells you what you can expect to get out of the search. Note that on “Letters” it doesn’t just insert the section name into the search field, but clarifies with “Search Sent Letters.” This minor hint means that I can predict the outcome of my action, which increases my confidence in the interface and in my ability to work with it.</p>

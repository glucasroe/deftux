<p><strong>What it is</strong>: <a href="https://www.mileiq.com/">MileIQ</a> is an application to help you keep track of your deductible mileage. It monitors your travel and gives you a breakdown of “Trips” which you categorize into “Business” and “Personal” by swiping. Longer swipes give you the ability to add metadata to the trips as you categorize them.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: This type of interface is now officially known as a “Tinder Swipe”—based off of the eponymous dating app. It’s a great application of the same idea in a different setting.</p>

<p>Reducing the amount of choices to a binary: “Business” or “Personal” is a wonderful statement of the app’s intent. Giving your user a simple, binary choice will always help them move through their data, especially when managing a long list of items. (Notice that she has over 100 drives to categorize)</p>

<p>The implementation of the longer swipe is ingenious. Some applications try to use longer swipes for different pieces of functionality. This is confusing because there isn’t usually a logical linkage between “Short swipe does x, long swipe does y.” There isn’t any map between the gesture and the outcome. This implementation spins it differently, swipe <em>direction</em> accomplishes the action, while longer swipes <em>give you more detail</em>. The mapping is very clear, a larger action in the same domain allows more functionality. Notice that it even maintains the state of the swiped out bar as it fades out the other screen elements.</p>

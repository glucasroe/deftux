        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: When a lesson ends in Skillshare, it autoplays the next lesson. In the meantime, it tells you what you just watched, the next lesson up, and gives you robust play options.</p>

<p><strong>Why it’s good</strong>: If you’ve been following this blog for a while, you might notice a habit of me enjoying fairly verbose interfaces. To be clear, I don’t <em>necessarily</em> prefer copy-heavy interfaces, but in the words of Luke W., <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945">obvious always wins</a>.</p>

<p>Skillshare does a lot here to tell you the current system state, where you are in it, and what is about to happen. It doesn’t expect you to intuit what’s happening, but gives you all of the details and controls.</p>

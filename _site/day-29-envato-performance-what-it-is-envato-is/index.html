        <p><strong>What it is</strong>: Envato is a company all about creative community commerce on the web. That&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re going to be talking about here though, their website is so insanely fast that it&rsquo;s worth talking about.</p>

<p><strong>Why it&rsquo;s good</strong>: The first time I clicked a link on this site, I honestly thought something went wrong. The entire page changed so quickly, could it have possibly loaded a new page that fast? I included a clock on this gif so that you could see how quickly this thing loads. I was in an incognito window too, so this is without caching.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become so used to websites loading slowly (even over broadband) that a multimedia site loading in under a second shocked me. Performance is such an integral part of experience, but we expect it to be a piece that&rsquo;s layered on at the end—a task that the engineers check off right before launch. Keeping performance on the table as a constant consideration is vital to building products that can deliver on user expectations for speed.</p>
